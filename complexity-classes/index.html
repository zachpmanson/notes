      <h1>Complexity Classes</h1>
    </header>

    <article><p>Complexity classes are sets of computational problems, organised by the resources required to solve them.  Most commonly this involves <a href="/decision-problems">decision problems</a> solvable using Turing machines and the relative time and memory problems would require under that model.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<h3 id="hardness">Hardness</h3>
<p>A problem X is hard for class C is every problem in C can be polynomial-time reduced to X, meaning no problem in C is harder than X.  Any algorithm that can solve X can solve all problems in C.</p>
<h3 id="completeness">Completeness</h3>
<p>A problem X is complete for class C if it is hard for C and contained within C.  This makes X the hardest possible problem within C (or one of many equally hard hardest problems in C).</p>
<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>
<p>These are in order of hardness, according to L = SL ⊆ NL ⊆ P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE = NPSPACE.</p>
<h3 id="l">L</h3>
<p>Class L is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a <strong>l</strong>ogarithmic amount of memory.  An example of this kind of problem is detemining whether a graph has a directed cycle. It is also called LSPACE.</p>
<h4 id="sl">SL</h4>
<p>Class SL (<strong>s</strong>ymmetric <strong>l</strong>ogspace) is the set of problems that can reduced to USTCON (undirected s-t connectivity, aka the <strong>undirected reachability problem</strong>).  USTCON is the problem of determining whether there exists a path between two vertices in an undirected graph.  This problem is SL-complete.</p>
<p>SL was first defined in 1982 by Harry R. Lewis and Christos Papadimitriou.  It was originally distinct from L since USTCON wasmconsidered NL at the time but didn't seem to require non-determinisim.  They defined the symmetric Turing machine and used it to define SL.  They showed that USTCON was complete for SL and proved that L ⊆ SL ⊆ NL.</p>
<p>In October 2004 Omer Reingold proved that SL = L and as a consequence, symmetric Turing machines are equivalent to deterministic Turing machines when limited to log space.</p>
<h3 id="nl">NL</h3>
<p>Class NL is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a <strong>n</strong>on-deterministic Turing machine using a <strong>l</strong>ogarithmic amount of memory. An example of an NL problem is the STCON (directed s-t connectivity aka the <strong>directed reachability problem</strong>), which is NL-complete.</p>
<h3 id="p">P</h3>
<p>Class P is the set of decision problems that are solvable on a deterministic Turing machine in <strong>p</strong>olynomial time.  These problems are generally considered to be tractable.  This class is  also called PTIME.  An example of a P problem is determining if a number is prime.</p>
<h3 id="np">NP</h3>
<p>Class NP is the set of decision problems that are solvable on a <strong>n</strong>on-deterministic Turing machine in <strong>p</strong>olynomial time.  It is an open question whether <code>P = NP</code>, though it's widely believed that <code>P != NP</code>.  An example of an NP problem is the travelling salesman problem.</p>
<h4 id="np-intermediate">NP-Intermediate</h4>
<p>Problems that aren't P but also aren't NP-complete are NP-intermediate. P = NP iff NP-intermediate is empty.  Some problems that are considered good candidates for being NP-intermediate are the graph isomorphism problem, factoring, and computing the discrete logarithm.</p>
<p>We haven't actually definitively proved this class exists.</p>
<h4 id="np-complete">NP-Complete</h4>
<p>There are many important NP-complete problems.  Famous examples include the travelling salesman problem (TSP), the knapsack problem and the boolean satisfiability problem.   Many important problems have been shown to be NP-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known</p>
