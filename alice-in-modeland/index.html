<hr />
<p>At the front of the house, Alice found two curious characters, both search engines. </p>
<p>"I am Googl-E," said the one plastered in advertisements. </p>
<p>"And I am Bingle-Dum," said the other, who was the smaller of the two, and sported a pout, as to having fewer visitors and opportunity for conversation than the other.</p>
<p>"I know you," said Alice. "Are you to present me with a puzzle? Perhaps  one of you tells the truth and the other lies?"</p>
<p>"Oh no," said Bingle-Dum.</p>
<p>"We both lie," added Googl-E. </p>
<p>"But there must be a clue," pouted Alice. "For how else am I to tell when to trust what you say?"</p>
<p>"That's the point!" laughed Bingle-Dum. </p>
<p>"We don't know when we're telling the truth either!" said Googl-E, finishing the other's sentence.</p>
<p>Alice sat down with a harrumph. </p>
<p>"This is truly an intolerable situation. If you both lie," </p>
<p>-- "And lie convincingly," added Bingle-Dum -- </p>
<p>"Yes, thank you. If that is so, then how am I to ever trust either of you?" </p>
<p>Googl-E and Bingle-Dum turned to face each other and shrugged.</p>
<p>At that moment, a mischievous feline grin began to appear, and Alice heard a whisper: "Well that's your fault for a lax regulatory environment and a body politic content to ignore the effect technology has on society, abrogating its duty to do so in a representative democracy!"</p>
<p>Alice scowled at the disappearing grin. "And a fat lot of good you are, Cheshire Cat!"</p></article>
