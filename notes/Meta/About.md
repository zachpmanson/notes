subtitle: Who am I

I'm Zach!

I have been a software engineer since 2022, currently helping businesses lower their electricity usage at Threadlet. I specialise in web development though I have an interest in permacomputing and low tech software.

I've built a few software [[projects]] for myself (primarily out of [[Spite Driven Development|anger]]) and I occasionally write [[posts]] on this site.

Sometimes you might see me under the name pavo online.  You can reach me by [email](mailto:zachpmanson@gmail.com) or on [[Fediverse|fedi]] at `@zach@zachmanson.com`.
