Apparently macOS [[internet]] recovery is fucked in Australia.  Holding Cmd+R while booting takes you into internet recovery.  Log into a Wi-Fi network, and then a spinning globe will appear.  Wait a while, around 20 min and it should show a loading bar and say that its "Starting Internet Recovery".  If this fails with error `2002F` and you are in Australia, try switching your [[DNS]] to Google DNS, and then restart and try again.

Found this solution in [this thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5219221?answerId=30613626022#30613626022).
