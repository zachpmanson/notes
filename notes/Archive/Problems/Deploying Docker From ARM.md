docker build -t your-image-tag --platform linux/amd64 .

Thank god for [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77182483), I only found after hours of failure.  [dunnkers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3047500/dunnkers) is a hero.  The person who commented this is now my enemy for life:
