The [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/162zbet/can_i_get_pixel_3_live_wallpaper_on_the_pixel_7/) is for Pixel 3 wallpapers on a Pixel 7 Pro, but I used it to take a Pixel 4a (5G) wallpaper to a Pixel 8.

Install WallMan ([site](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.colorata.wallman)).  Alleges it is also available on F-Droid.  [Source code](https://gitlab.com/colorata/wallman).  Wallpapers should remain even after uninstalling wallpapers.

I have saved a copy of the APK onto the Internet Archive, [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240121080337/https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo/com.colorata.wallman_6.apk).
