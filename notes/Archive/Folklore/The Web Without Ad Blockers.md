Dan Luu's thread on the state of the internet without ad blockers, which programmers rarely experience, [posted on 2022-08-29](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1564292487744978946).

It's astounding how bad the web is without an ad blocker
  
This tax on using the web, which funds most of it, pays most of the highest paid programmers ($750k/yr+), etc., doesn't impact programmers, who almost all use ad blockers  

The whole situation reminds me of the lottery tax

In both cases, the tax is disproportionately paid by people who are disadvantaged in a variety of ways, which effectively pays for "free stuff" for everybody else  

I would've guessed that many fewer play the lottery, but from looking at the numbers, the %ages aren't so different

I've heard quite a few people (mostly Google employees, but also "smart contrarian" folks) say ads are good because they give users information, etc., but I think it's hard to say that with a straight face if you actually try non-adblocked browsing, let alone the flow of money.

The highest value search terms ("divorce lawyer", etc.), make their money because advertisers are effectively bidding to get the highest ranking search result, and of course there are all of the ads that trick people into installing spyware/adware, and worse yet, the ads that are actually malware. The one time (that I know of, anyway), my computer has gotten owned is when I was browsing without an ad blocker and a site with a 0-day malware ad payload broke through my browser's sandbox and installed malware on my computer.

> later work showing that making ads "too similar" to search results causes users to confuse ads with search results, followed by Google making ads look enough like search results that the vast majority of users confuse ads with search results, etc.

One of the most common replies is that people have a moral obligation to not block ads to support sites. 

I tried clicking on FB ads recently and almost every ad was a scam (the first two are bitcoin giveaway scams).  

I feel no obligation to support scams, malware, phishing, etc.

Another common response is that you only get bad ads on obscure sketchy sites, but no one who looks at ads can honestly say that.  
  
It's common to get scam ads on google.com and facebook.com as well as their ad networks, which are everywhere.

What's the top ad for an gambling addiction management app?  
  
Of course it's a gambling app, because the CLV (customer lifetime value) for a gambling addict on a gambling app is very high and the CLV an addict on an addiction management app is zero.

To give a rough idea of how much exploiting gamblers is worth, the #137 streamer on twitch was offered $10M/yr to stream gambling for 30 minutes a day, much more than any non-gambling sponsor would pay him.  
  
The #42 streamer made $10M/month, mostly from gambling sponsorship.

The CLV of addicting someone to gambling and/or getting an addict on your platform is huge.  
  
It's the nature of unregulated capitalism, particularly ads and engagement optimizing algorithms, to connect casinos to the people with the highest propensity for addiction.
