Excerpt from Palm Sunday, where Kurt Vonnegut grades his own books.

---

Yes, and it wasn't the only bad job I ever did. I have graded my separate works from A to D. The grades I hand out to myself do not place me in literary history. I am comparing myself with myself. Thus can I give myself an A-plus for Cat's Cradle, while knowing that there was a writer named William Shakespeare. The report card is chronological, so you can plot my rise and fall on graph paper, if you like:


<table><tbody>
<tr><td>Player Piano</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Sirens of Titan</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mother Night</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cat's Cradle</td><td>A-plus</td></tr>
<tr><td>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slaughterhouse-Five</td><td>A-plus</td></tr>
<tr><td>Welcome to the Monkey House</td><td>B-minus</td></tr>
<tr><td>Happy Birthday, Wanda June</td><td>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>Breakfast of Champions</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slapstick</td><td>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jailbird</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>Palm Sunday</td><td>C</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
