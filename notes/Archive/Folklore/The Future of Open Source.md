The year is 2028. All major open source projects are fully staffed and funded by multiple competing spy agencies who are constantly auditing other agencies work, implementing features as requested by their respected governments, as well as trying to slip malware past each other.

Paradoxically, open source has never been more secure, maintainer burnout is at an all time low; and everyone does all work at a healthy pace during working hours.

Wayland even suddenly got good accessibility features implemented when it was realized that it made keylogging tools easier to write.
