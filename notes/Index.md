This site is an archive and collection of my personal notes.  This is automatically generated with [[Ochrs]] and is changing constantly, unlike my [main site](https://zachmanson.com) which should stay relatively stable.  The goal of this is to [learn](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up) [with](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) [the garage](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public) [door up](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Working+with+the+garage+door+up).

The [sitemap](/404.html) shows the full wiki structure. This site currently has <ochrs:pagecount> pages.  [[Domain Based Link Colours|Purple links]] are internal, [pink links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)) point to sites on other domains. 

The site [source](https://github.com/pavo-etc/notes) is editable [here](https://github.dev/pavo-etc/notes/).
