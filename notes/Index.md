This site is an [[archive]] and my personal [[notes]]. It is changing constantly. The goal of this is to [learn](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up) [with](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) [the garage](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public) [door up](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Working+with+the+garage+door+up).

There are currently <ochrs:page-count> pages.  See what I've been working on in [[recent changes]] or the [[sitemap]] for the full structure.  You can also navigate using [[tags]].

The site is [open source](https://github.com/pavo-etc/notes), automatically generated with [[Ochrs]].

I don't like reading things I think I could write myself, and I don't like writing things I wouldn't read myself. Hopefully this helps me get over that.
