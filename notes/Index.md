This site is an archive and collection of my personal notes.  This is automatically generated with [[Ochrs]] and is changing constantly, unlike my [main site](https://zachmanson.com) which should stay relatively stable.  The goal of this is to [learn](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up) [with](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) [the garage](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public) [door up](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Working+with+the+garage+door+up).

The [[sitemap]] shows the full wiki structure, currently containing <ochrs:page-count> pages. See the list of [[recent changes]] or the list of [[tags]].

[[Domain Based Link Colours|Purple links]] are internal, [pink links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)) point to sites on other domains.  The site [source](https://github.com/pavo-etc/notes) is editable [here](https://github.dev/pavo-etc/notes/).

I don't like reading things I think I could write myself, and I don't like writing things I wouldn't read myself.  Hopefully this helps me get over that.
