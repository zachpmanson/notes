This site is an archive and collection of my personal notes.  This is automatically generated with [[Ochrs]] and is changing constantly, unlike my [main site](https://zachmanson.com) which should stay relatively stable.  The goal of this is to [learn with](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up) [the garage](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public) [door up](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Working+with+the+garage+door+up).
