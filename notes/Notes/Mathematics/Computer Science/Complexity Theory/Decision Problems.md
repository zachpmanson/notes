A decision prblem is a computation problem that can be posed as a yes-no question on a set of inputs, with an infinite set of possible input sets. A method for solving a decision problem is a *decision procedure*, usually given in the form of an algorithm.  Solvable decision problems are called *decidable*.

Decidable problems are placed in different [[Complexity Classes]] depending on the resources required to solve them.

These are distinct from function problems, which can give more complex answers than the boolean options of decision problems.
