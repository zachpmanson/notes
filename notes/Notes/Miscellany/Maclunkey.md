Greedo says "maclunkey" before shooting Han in the Disney+ 2019 release of Star Wars, though this was left untranslated, making it the only untranslated word in this scene. These [changes are said to have been by George Lucas](https://web.archive.org/web/20191112170437/https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961173/disney-plus-star-wars-han-solo-greedo-new-hope-edit-george-lucas) in the same period he was working on 3D versions of the film before selling Lucasfilm to Disney. [Matt Wood stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112205209/https://twitter.com/matthewood/status/1326991077258133504) the line was added because it was the only word from the original Greedo audio that hadn't been used in the 1977 release, as performed by Larry Ward.

In The Mandalorian, Bib Fortuna says "maclunkey" to his guard before the guard is shot by Boba Fett in 2020.
