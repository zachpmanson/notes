I'd like to fully grasp Lemmy and [Kbin](https://github.com/ernestwisniewski/kbin), especially with Reddit having killed all the good ways of interacting with it.  They are [partially interoperable with Mastodon](https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/03/27/the-elephant-in-the-room) and with each other(?), but I am interested to see how split communities work.

[Voyager](https://github.com/aeharding/voyager) ([live](https://wefwef.app/)) is a well-made client for lemmy, designed to mimic the design of Apollo for Reddit.  Potentially the best [[React]] app I've ever seen?  Certainly the best emulation of iOS I've ever seen.

[mlmym](https://github.com/rystaf/mlmym) is a clone of old.reddit for lemmy.  It is excellent.
