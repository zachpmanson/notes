An agent is something that acts.  For computer agents this includes "operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals"

A rational agent is one that is able to operate when there is uncertainty.

An agent can perceive its environment with sensors and act upon the environment with actuators. Sensors perceive percepts. A percept sequence is everything an agent has ever perceived.  An agents behaviour can be described with agent function that maps any percept sequence to an action.

Agents have performance measures that are the goals they aim to achieve.  Often information gathering is a rational decision to make in order to achieve goals.
