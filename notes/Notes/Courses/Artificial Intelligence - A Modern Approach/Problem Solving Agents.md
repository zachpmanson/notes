[[Agents]] can solve problems using:

- goal formulation
- problem formulations
- search actions, searching for sequences leading to solutions
- execution

Problems are made up of:

- the set of states a [[Task Environments|environment]] can be in (state space)
- initial state
- goal states
- actions
- transition models
- action cost functions

Usually problems have to make abstractions of the world to represent their environment.
