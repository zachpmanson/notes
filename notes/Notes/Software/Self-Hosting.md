Notes on the process of running services on your own machines.

Self-hosting allows you to have full control over your own data.  This comes at the cost of needing to manage your own data, a tradeoff everyone will have consider for themselves.

Nextcloud is a fantastic platform you can use to self-host a number of different services.  It isn't without its hiccups but its generally quite easy to set up (see [[Nextcloud Phone Photo Upload]]).  I personally run a Nextcloud instance for sharing files, backups, and managing my RSS feeds ([Nextcloud News](https://github.com/nextcloud/news)).
