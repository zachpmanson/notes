The process of making computers learn to solve problems themselves, based on examples of the problem.

>Suppose we arrange for some automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance and provide a mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance. We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would "learn" from its experience.

Important concepts:

- "weight assignment"
	- weights are variables, assignments are the values
- weight assignment has "actual performance"
	- the model's ability achieve its goal
	- this is distinct from the "results", meaning the output e.g. results are moves taken vs  actual performance is winning the game 
- "automatic means" of testing performance
- "mechanism" for improving performance by changing weight assignments
	- can compare two versions performance and move weights closer to the better performing model
