>The Federation, or as often called the "Fediverse", refers to a global social network composed of nodes that talk to each other. Each of them is an installation of software which supports one of the federated social web protocols.

The fediverse is a series of decentralised instances of social networks that are able to communicate with one another using shared protocols.  It uses a few different protocols over the different services, but ActivityPub (and its flagship platform Mastodon) is the most popular by a considerable margin.

## Mastodon

You can find me on mastodon at @zach@zachmanson.com (this is an [[Mastodon Domain Alias]] to whatever my current account is).  Mastodon is by far the most popular protocol that runs on top of ActivityPub at the time of writing.  It is somewhat interoperable with many others such as PixelFed and Lemmy, but since the message formats aren't the same this can be limited, both in content and usability within existing interfaces.

## Further Investigation

I'd like to fully grasp Lemmy and [Kbin](https://github.com/ernestwisniewski/kbin), especially with Reddit being as conflicted as it is right now.  I would like to know how interoperable they are with Mastodon (do I need to actually make a kbin account), each other, and how split communities work.  Their potential excites me though.
