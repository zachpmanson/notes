> Open Source is fascinating. Imagine a pastry chef who spends all day making pastries at work going home to make pastries in the evening. Imagine them wandering around giving these pastries to others for free. Imagine them finding out their free pastries are a huge part of a local company’s lunch offering. Imagine the company complaining because the chef doesn’t make enough pastries for them. Imagine the chef staying up all night making them more pasties instead of just telling them to fuck off.
