- ~~[[Ochrs]]-deploy, obviously~~ No longer using this, now switched to Obsidian Git + GitHub actions for deploying
- Advanced Tables, proper table support
- ~~Automatically Reveal Active File, automatically reveal the active file in the navigation when you open a file.~~ no longer needed, now a built in option
- Obsidian Git, a pretty great [[Git]] client that attaches itself to Obsidian
- Obsidian Linter, provides a very customisable linter
- Obsidian Commander, allows any palette command to be added as a shortcut to any panel
  - Currently I only use this to add a shortcut to the `Git: Create Backup` command
