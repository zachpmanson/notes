Things that are annoying get fixed. Have a legacy function that is truly disgusting, uses dodgy abstractions and produces footguns but you don't have the time to rewrite it right now? Give it a truly fucked up name, that reflects how ugly it is on the inside. Make the next developer feel bad for using this.

A great example of this is the [React `__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED`](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/issues/3896).
