Query params are a simple kind of global state that can be stored in a link! Thatâ€™s so useful! When using [[React]] and [[Next.js]], using `nuqs` makes query params super easy to manage, as if they are `useState` calls! So please use it. It even supports date parsing, enums, and arrays!

For example, query params are great for storing what particular location you just selected, or for the tab that is currently active.

Query params also allow you to skip writing state models!

(they also don't trigger full page rerenders in Next.js Pages Router)
