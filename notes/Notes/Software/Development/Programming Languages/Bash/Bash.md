Bash is a command line shell for [[Unix]] and scripting programming l[uage well suited to writing glueware.  Unices where it isn't available usually have a similar language such as zsh, fish or ksh.  It was designed as a replacement for the Bourne Shell (hence the name Bourne Again SHell) by Brian Fox and released in 1989 for the GNU Project.
