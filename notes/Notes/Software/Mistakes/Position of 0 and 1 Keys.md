On modern QWERTY keyboards, `1` is positioned at on the left of the keyboard and `0` is positioned on the right.  Despite being commonplace this is actually a strange arrangement.  The reason for this is due to the design of typewriters.

>Keyboard layouts have evolved over time, usually alongside major technology changes. Particularly influential have been: the [Sholes and Glidden typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholes_and_Glidden_typewriter "Sholes and Glidden typewriter") (1874, also known as Remington No. 1), the first commercially successful typewriter, which introduced [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") its successor, the Remington No. 2 (1878), which introduced the shift key; the [IBM Selectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric "IBM Selectric") (1961), a very influential electric typewriter, which was imitated by computer keyboards and the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC "IBM PC") (1981), namely the [Model M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M "Model M") (1985), which is the basis for many modern keyboard layouts.

Early QWERTY typewriters didn't include keys for `0` or `1`, these characters were written using `O` could be written `I`.   This reduced construction costs and reduced design complexity reducing the total number of keys.

Once the shift key was introduced, `l` was favoured as a replacement `1` as required a single keystroke rather than two for `I`.  This heralded the addition of the `0` key as `O` required a second keypress to on these machines.  `234567890` was considered better than `023456789`, so was placed at the end of the numbers row.  A `1` key was later widely added and was placed at the start, but the convention of `0` on the far right was already established.
