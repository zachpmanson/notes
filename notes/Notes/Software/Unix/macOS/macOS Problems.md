General desktop environment

- Windows don't snap, and there is no sane option to do this without external tools. This is insane an unacceptable. Finally seems to be changing in next macOS update.
- Hiding secret options behind the Options key is insane, especially for things that should be standard (like the Zoom option in the long-press green traffic light option)
- All the built in Alt Tab equivalents are bad.  Why the fuck would I ever want to switch to an application that has no open windows
- Also I know there are are historical reasons, but most apps defaulting to never closing and just permanently clogging up my dock and running in the background, there are so few times this behaviour is preferable.  I don't even care if its still running in the background, just please do no pollute one of my main navigation tools.
- Cmd+Q is both too easy and too hard to hit. I want to use it all the time because so many apps will pollute my dock if I don't, so I'm glad its a simple easy keyboard shortcut.  But I hit it SO often accidentally instead of Cmd+A and Cmd+W. This was so annoying that I've remapped it globally.

Finder:

- No simple way to set snap to grid as the default at all times
- No way to shift select multiple options when using the grid layout, even when they have been arrange into a grid
- Insane that the default keybind for opening a file is Cmd+O and not Enter.  I know its always been like this and the Enter key is used for renaming in many places on the operating system, but making the most common operation (opening a file) take 2 keys is crazy.  This may qualify as a relic since the decision to make Enter the rename shortcut was rushed according to [this story](https://www.folklore.org/A_Floppy_named_lsadkfjalhkjh.html).  See some severe cope in this [thread on the topic](https://www.folklore.org/A_Floppy_named_lsadkfjalhkjh.html).

When macOS starts running out of resources (I am assuming RAM) and you have audio playing, the audio will cut out and loop in a way I've never seen any other operating system do. I have heard this kind of effect in movies when a glitch happens or a computer starts breaking down, and I don't think its a leap to guess that this is because the people making movies have been influenced by a higher-than-average usage of macOS.
