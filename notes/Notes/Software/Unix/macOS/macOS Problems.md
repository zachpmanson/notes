General desktop environment

- Windows don't snap, and there is no sane option to do this without external tools. This is insane an unacceptable. Finally seems to be changing in next macOS update.
- Hiding secret options behind the Options key is insane, especially for things that should be standard (like the Zoom option in the long-press green traffic light option)

Finder:

- No simple way to set snap to grid as the default at all times
- No way to shift select multiple options when using the grid layout, even when they have been arrange into a grid
