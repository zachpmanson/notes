The word "ampersand" comes from the amalgamation of the phrase "& per se &", where "&" is pronounced as "and".  The phrase was common in the 1800s, as it was  standard practice to pronounce letter names (as opposed to single letter words like "a") in the form `<letter> per se <letter>`, and ampersand was considered the 27th letter of the alphabet.  "Per se" was used as it means "by itself" in Latin.

An alternate form "epershand" originates  from Scotland.
