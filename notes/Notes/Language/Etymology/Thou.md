"Thou" is an archiac informal version of the word "you". 

> In Early Modern English, _thou_ was the singular and _you_ was the plural. Plural _you_ came to be used as a polite form of address (similar to the French _vous_, which is also used for the plural), but over time this polite form became more and more common, eventually displacing the singular _thou_ altogether.

> This explains a peculiarity of traditional Quaker speech, which one often hears in films set in the early Americas. The Quakers opposed making any distinctions of rank, so they insisted on addressing everyone as _thou_, not as _you_. The irony is that today we perceive _thou_ to be archaic and formal, while the original intent is to be more informal.
