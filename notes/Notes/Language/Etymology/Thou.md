"Thou" is an archiac informal version of the word "you". 

> In Early Modern English, *thou* was the singular and *you* was the plural. Plural *you* came to be used as a polite form of address (similar to the French *vous*, which is also used for the plural), but over time this polite form became more and more common, eventually displacing the singular *thou* altogether.

> This explains a peculiarity of traditional Quaker speech, which one often hears in films set in the early Americas. The Quakers opposed making any distinctions of rank, so they insisted on addressing everyone as *thou*, not as *you*. The irony is that today we perceive *thou* to be archaic and formal, while the original intent is to be more informal.
