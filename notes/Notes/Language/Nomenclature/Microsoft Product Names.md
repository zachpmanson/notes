Microsoft somehow manages to have constantly terrible names.

- Xbox One (the third Xbox)
- Xbox One X & One S followed by the completely different Xbox Series X & Series S
- Copilot+ PCs
- GitHub Copilot Workspace, completely unrelated to Github Copilot and GitHub Workspaces
	- This is also completely unrelated to every other Microsoft product that is X Copilot, or X+Copilot.
		- Microsoft Copilot
		- Microsoft 365 Copilot
- .NET, its predecessors, its children and the confusing relationship between them
