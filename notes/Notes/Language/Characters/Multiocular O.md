ꙮ (U+A66E) is a Unicode character originating from a single phrase from a version of the Book of Psalms written in an extinct language, Old Church Slavonic.  It was written in 1429 and is in Russia.

The character is used as a stylised version of the Cyrillic O (U+041E), and is used in the phrase "серафими многоꙮчитїи", meaning "many-eyed seraphim". A seraph (plural seraphim) is a type of angel.

## It had one recorded use and was still wrong

This character was incorporated into the Unicode standard but mistakenly only included 7 eyes in the description when the original character has 10.

This was updated in version 15.0.0 of the Unicode specification when [Jonty Wareing](http://jonty.co.uk/), the person who originally transcribed the character for the spec, noticed the error in a tweet discussing the history of the character.
