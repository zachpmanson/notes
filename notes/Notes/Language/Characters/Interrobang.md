‽ (U+203D) is a punctuation mark glyph combining an exclamation mark and a question mark.  It was first discussed by Martin Speckter in 1962 for use with rhetorical questions in marketing materials, which he proposed in an article in the magazine TYPEtalks.  It was later created for the Americana typeface by Richard Isbell for American Type Founders, and by 1968 a dedicated ‽ key on some Remington typewriters.
