Rebracketing is the process some words undergo where the original etymological morphemes are broken down or restructured.  A classic example is "hamburg"+"er" becoming "ham"+"burger", as evidenced by child "cheese"-"burger".

This phenomenon is responsible for the word apron ("a"+"napron" -> "an"+"apron") and outrage ("outre"+"age" -> "out"+"rage").
