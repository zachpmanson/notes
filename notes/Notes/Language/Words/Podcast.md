*Podcast* is a portmanteau of *iPod* and *broadcast*.

The word *iPod* was inspired by the EVA Pods from 2001: A Space Odyssey, where an iPod functions as a companion to a personal computer much like a pod is a companion to a larger spacecraft.

The word *pod* when used in relation to spacecraft is inspired by pods containing seeds like peas.

*Broadcast* comes from the words *broad* and *cast*, where *broadcast* is to sow seeds by scattering them.

So by pure coincidence, both parts of *podcast* are related to seeds.
