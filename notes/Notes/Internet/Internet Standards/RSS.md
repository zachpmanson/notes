Platform agnostic way to follow anything?  Amazing.  This is what the internet was made for.

I use Nextcloud News as my RSS reader since it has an Android app, is pretty straightfoward and was dead simple to add to my existing Nextcloud installation.

## This Site

I have been asked to add RSS to this website but I'm still contemplating how to do that in a sane way, since it doesn't really have a chronological ordering.  New pages are often very short and slowly get bigger over time, which would make for very poor feed if you just get notified every time I add an undercooked page.  XXIIVV has a feed where Devine posts what they have been writing about recently, which could be interesting, thought for me this would like happen if I merged the blog into this site.  Which isn't a bad idea now that I write it down hmm.

An alternate approach could be a feed that only notifies followers when a certain page gets past a certain word count.
