subtitle: Really Simple Syndication.

Platform agnostic way to follow anything?  Amazing.  This is what the [[internet]] was made for.

I use Nextcloud News as my RSS reader since it has an Android app, is pretty straightfoward and was dead simple to add to my existing Nextcloud installation.  NetNewsWire is also extremely good if you are on macOS.

## Digital Gardens

[[Digital gardens]] aren't a medium that obviously lends itself to use with RSS due to its strict focus on chronological ordering.  Digital gardens encourage incremental growth of pages and incomplete, living works.

Potential ways of integrating RSS:

- all new pages become a feed item ([metasyn.pw](https://metasyn.pw))
- all pages become a feed item once they hit a certain word count
- all pages become a feed item when they are assigned a publish date
- feeds are generated from tags
- all edits become feed items
- manually written feed items ([wiki.xxiivv.com](https://wiki.xxiivv.com))

Most of these aren't mutually exclusive, and a site can have many RSS feeds tracking different things. This site produces an RSS feed for each tag, but only includes pages that have a publish date.  See [[tags]] for links to all of these, or [[posts]] for the main feed.  See [[Ochrs]] for more details.
