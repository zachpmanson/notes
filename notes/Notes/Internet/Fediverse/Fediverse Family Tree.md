For keeping track of software forks in the fediverse, and why they exist.

- Misskey
	- [Calckey](https://joinfirefish.org/) (later renamed to the equally bad name, firefish), more feature rich?
	- [Sharkey](https://joinsharkey.org), generally follows upstream
- Pleroma
	- [Akkoma](https://akkoma.social/), "is a specialised fork of Pleroma. It is faster-paced in development and aligns itself more closely with Misskey than Pleroma mainline"
- [[Mastodon]]
	- [glitch-soc](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/) , a friendly fork of Mastodon with a large number of experiemental features, appears to follow upstream
	- [hometown](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown), a gentle fork of Mastodon wanting to add a small number of features and generally stay close to upstream (though its a few thousand commits behind)
- Lemmy, a reddit-like fediverse server
- Kbin, a reddit-like fediverse server with some masto-style microblogging aspects?  It is interoperable with Lemmy allegedly
	- Mbin, a "community focused" fork of mbin that will.  Is apparently much more open to community input and PRs.
