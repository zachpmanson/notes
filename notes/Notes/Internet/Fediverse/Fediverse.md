> The Federation, or as often called the "Fediverse", refers to a global social network composed of nodes that talk to each other. Each of them is an installation of software which supports one of the federated social web protocols.

The fediverse is a series of social networks that are able to communicate with one another using shared protocols.  It uses a few different protocols over the different services, but [[ActivityPub]] (and its flagship platform [[Mastodon]]) is the most popular.

## Lemmy/Kbin

I'd like to fully grasp Lemmy and [Kbin](https://github.com/ernestwisniewski/kbin), especially with Reddit being as conflicted as it is right now.  I would like to know how interoperable they are with Mastodon (do I need to actually make a kbin account?), each other, and how split communities work.  Their potential excites me though.

[Voyager](https://github.com/aeharding/voyager) ([live](https://wefwef.app/)) is a well-made client for lemmy, designed to mimic the design of Apollo for Reddit.  Potentially the best [[react]] app I've ever seen?  Certainly the best emulation of iOS I've ever seen.

[mlmym](https://github.com/rystaf/mlmym) is a clone of old.reddit for lemmy.  It is excellent.
