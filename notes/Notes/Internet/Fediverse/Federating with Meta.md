Meta's rumoured Twitter competitor Threads has caused a stir in the [[fediverse]]. Some suggesting fedi instances should preemptively block Threads, others willing to wait and see what happens.  At the time of writing (June 2023) it is unclear how this will pan out. Many fear the threat of [embrace, extend, extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish), but others are excited at the prospect of the fediverse becoming more significant.

Meta: "MAY I JOIN YOU?"  
[By David Revoy](https://framapiaf.org/@davidrevoy/110583258129951932)

One of the oft-touted benefits of the fediverse is that it would be resilient to corporate enshittification. It will be interesting to see how the fediverse handles real threats.

	- meta gains little in terms of data collection ability since activitypub lacks privacy anyway, and what it does gain isn't very useful, and the current fediverse population size is not large enough to be worth pursuing for data collection
	- its seems unlikely that Meta actually sees the fediverse as a threat
	- the Gchat/XMPP embrace/extend/extinguish example is flawed
	- Meta isn't evil without motivation
	- "So why _is_ Meta going to use ActivityPub?  Here’s the thing; _I haven’t the faintest fucking clue_.  It does not obviously help Meta in any way to have interoperability with ActivityPub"
