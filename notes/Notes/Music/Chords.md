Chords are combinations of 3+ notes, starting with the root.

## Intervals

An interval is the difference in pitch between two sounds.  In the context of a chord, pitches can be vertical or harmonic.

## Inversions

Inversions are alternate forms of chords that arrange the same notes differently. 

- root position, where the root of the chord is the lowest note played
- first inversion, third is the lowest note
- second inversion, fifth is the lowest note
- third inversion, sixth or seventh is the lowest note

## Triads

A triad (aka harmony) is the most basic kind of chord consisting of a root, third, and fifth.  This is sometimes called stacked thirds, since their is a third between the 2nd and 3rd note.

A third is an interval encompassing 3 staff positions (inclusive):

- major third spans 4 semitones
- minor third spans 3 semitones.

A fifth spans 5 staff positions (inclusive):

- perfect fifth spans 7 semitones (most common in Western music)
- diminished fifth spans  7 semitones
- augmented fifth spans 7 semitones
