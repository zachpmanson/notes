Minecraftle is a game fusing the gameplay of Wordle with crafting recipes from Minecraft.  It started as a university project I worked on in 2022 in a small team for [CITS3403](https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/) (one of the better units in [[UWA Computer Science]]).  It is built with Vanilla JS+Flask with a SQLite database, and the [live version](https://minecraftle.zachmanson.com) is deployed with nginx on DigitalOcean.

We received the top mark for the project and I continued development after we submitted it.  The source code is publicly available on the [repo](https://github.com/pavo-etc/minecraftle).  Since submission I've made a number of changes, some of which are enumerated in [this blog post](https://zachmanson.com/blog/minecraftle-v1.1/).

The game has daily puzzles and global leaderboards, with player count peaking at 300k MAU.
