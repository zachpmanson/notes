subtitle: An open source wiki generator.

This website is generated with Ochrs, which began as a fork of [Nchrs](https://nchrs.xyz), which itself began as a fork of [XXIIVV](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html).

Ochrs is a wiki engine supporting [[Markdown]], [[tags]], hierarchical structure, backlinks, and chronological feeds.  Ochrs is written in Python and outputs a flat static [[HTML]] directory that can be directly served.

Since [[Ochrs 2.0]] is it designed to be built from an [[Obsidian]] vault.
