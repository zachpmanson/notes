I have had the job title "Software Engineer" for 632 days now and it still feels like a lie most of the time.  

Either because

- it's prefixed by "graduate"
- I tricked a floundering company in to hiring me between waves of layoffs for obscene amounts of money
	- more money than most of the people I worked along side who were far smarter than me
	- and who got laid off with me as if we equally deserved it
- I tricked a company into hiring me because they liked my [[Minecraftle|minecraft]] game (twice)
- [[software]] engineers aren't real engineers
- [[web development]] isn't even real software engineering
- I couldn't write a compiler if you held me at gun point
- all I do is [[glue work]] and waste time
- all I do is build "dashboard for x company to monitor y"
- I don't really understand how half the tools I use work, I just know the buttons I need to press
- when I say "backend" I mean "write db query and write some trivial transformation into JSON"
- when I say "frontend" I mean "tailwind and knowing how [[Notes/Software/Development/Web Development/React]] rendering work"
- pipelines are just [[VendorOps]]
- I spend all day in baby languages
- all my technical opinions are stolen or surface level
- I feel like I knew more in [[UWA Computer Science|university]] even though this is obviously not true
	- I just don't have to write [[C]] anymore
- nothing I make has an interesting or novel explanation behind it
- when I say "system administration" I mean "apt install nginx and google"
- when I say "[[open source]]" I mean "I chuck my worthless repetitive shit under MIT"
- for every ounce of power and efficiency the laptop I write this on has, my code still runs slow because I am so high up the stack I've never had to see the bottom
- all I do is write tomorrow's legacy code

Obviously much of this is silly and wrong and I'm doing better than most of the people I know, but all I ever do is realise how much higher the Dunning-Kruger rollercoaster ride goes.
