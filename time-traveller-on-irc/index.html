G° : but you have a past... you remember things, and if one changes...?
TimeTravel_0 : Yes...
TimeTravel_0 : but they are different.
TimeTravel_0 : The fact that I am here changes this world line.
G° : so you havn&#39;t tried mucking with anything?
TimeTravel_0 : No...but I could.
TimeTravel_0 : Its just not that moral in my opinion.
TimeTravel_0 : Besides...Im not here for that.
G° : thing is, you might not have changed anything because you already
were 
here
TimeTravel_0 : Thats right!!!
TimeTravel_0 : Very good.
TimeTravel_0 : In fact..I&#39;ve noticed samll changes.
G° : I mean you upstairs asleep wouldn&#39;t have known if you now was 
downstairs
G° : you have? thats what i was getting it
TimeTravel_0 : No...he knows me.
TimeTravel_0 : Yes...small changes.
G° : care to give an example?
TimeTravel_0 : Sure...
TimeTravel_0 : Football....(sorry) games that were lost that should have 
been won.
TimeTravel_0 : Incidental news stories that havent happened.
TimeTravel_0 : Books not written.
TimeTravel_0 : Small stuff like that.
G° : wow. surely that can&#39;t be anything to do with you?
TimeTravel_0 : No.
TimeTravel_0 : By definition, this world line is not the same as mine.
G° : so how come do you think?
TimeTravel_0 : Physics.
TimeTravel_0 : Have you ever been in a room that has mirrors on all the 
walls?
G° : you with the infinate worlds with infinate possibilities theory then?
TimeTravel_0 : Yes!!!
TimeTravel_0 : Multipole world theory is correct.
G° : like sliders
TimeTravel_0 : Sliders?
G° : tv show
G° : before your time... LOL
TimeTravel_0 : Hmmm...havent seent hat one.
G° : hmmm. I must admit, that theory has always bothered me
TimeTravel_0 : Have you heard of Schrodinger&#39;s cat?
G° : I mean, why bother? why create all these slightly different
worlds? no 
offence to you, just never liked it.
Yareisa : yes
G° : yes, talking about it the other day
TimeTravel_0 : Well...there&#39;s a little joke in 2036.
G° : can&#39;t remember though
TimeTravel_0 : If the cat had a distortion machine (time) he may not be in 
the box at all.
G° : oh yeah, that was it... LOL
G° : ( i was wondering if you were still ther Yar)
Yareisa : yes, deep in though
Yareisa : thought
G° : sorry, I have to call you Yareisa, I don&#39;t like yar....
Yareisa : ok!
G° : so. what can we do for you tonight TT? How come your here?
TimeTravel_0 : I enjoy the &quot;paranormal&quot; chat rooms for 2 reasons.
TimeTravel_0 : 1. I find the people here are more open to ideas.
TimeTravel_0 : 2. I find it ironic that when what they are looking for
falls 
in their lap, they can&#39;t believe it.
G° : sorry you&#39;ve been doing all the talking....
8wyrmkin_37 has joined the conversation.
TimeTravel_0 : Its okay,
wyrmkin_37 : hello to room
TimeTravel_0 : I learn a lot from you too.
G° : hi wyrm
Yareisa : hi wyrm
wyrmkin_37 : hey
G° : so who owns the machine TT?
G° : who do you work for?
TimeTravel_0 : The military.
TimeTravel_0 : Im a soldier.
TimeTravel_0 : But civilan time travle is not far off.
G° : do they know your in the year 2000 chatting to us when you should be 
returning with the 5110?
TimeTravel_0 : Good question!!!
G° : LOL How would they know?
G° : unless your machine records jumps?
TimeTravel_0 : No...but i will return just seconds after I left from their 
point of view.
TimeTravel_0 : I will only age a bit more than expected.
wyrmkin_37 : what matter of singularities?
G° : Imust say, your a very friendly, chatty soldier...
Yareisa : temporal phase shift
Yareisa : oops, thinking aloud again
wyrmkin_37 : anti-matter or dimensional?
TimeTravel_0 : Well...I only fought in the civil war.  The military put me 
through school and I was qualified for this mission.
TimeTravel_0 : The singularities distort gravity.
TimeTravel_0 : Ill be happy to go through the physics.  The basics are 
already known.
wyrmkin_37 : please........proceed
Yareisa : please do
TimeTravel_0 : Ok
TimeTravel_0 : In 1967, a physist named Tipler came up with the basic 
equations for time travel based on massive rotating cylinders...ever heard 
of him?
wyrmkin_37 : in omni?
G° : no, sorry
TimeTravel_0 : no problem...
TimeTravel_0 : are you familiar with black holes and Stephen Halking?
TimeTravel_0 : Sorry...spelling
Yareisa : to some degree, yes
TimeTravel_0 : Ok
wyrmkin_37 : .......a brief history of time
TimeTravel_0 : Yes.
TimeTravel_0 : Black holes distort gravity...which distorts time.
wyrmkin_37 : theory
TimeTravel_0 : At there center is a singularity.
G° : yeah, with you so far
TimeTravel_0 : No...it is proved.
TimeTravel_0 : In 1969, science invented a clock sensitive enough to show 
the time difference in a multiple sotry building.
wyrmkin_37 : kewl
TimeTravel_0 : On the first floor...time runs slower due to gravity.
TimeTravel_0 : Clser to the center of the Earth.
wyrmkin_37 : get outa here
G° : also the 2 clocks, one in a plane that flew off and came back
different 
to the other one
TimeTravel_0 : Yes!!!
G° : ok
wyrmkin_37 : gravitation
TimeTravel_0 : The effect is magnified greatly in a black hole.
TimeTravel_0 : As it turns out...
TimeTravel_0 : If you encounter a black hole that is spinning and has an 
electrified field, you will not be killed passing through its massive 
gravitational fiuelds.
TimeTravel_0 : regreting asking yet&gt;
Yareisa : no
TimeTravel_0 : Ok
wyrmkin_37 : no
Yareisa : I&#39;m hooked
TimeTravel_0 : In about a year...
G° : is this the omeg point theory?
G° : omega?
TimeTravel_0 : CERN will discover some very odd things as a result of
their 
high energy experiments.
TimeTravel_0 : in about a year.
TimeTravel_0 : from your point of view.
wyrmkin_37 : cern?
TimeTravel_0 : in Geneva.
Yareisa : particle accelerator
wyrmkin_37 : oh
TimeTravel_0 : They will accidently create microsingularities.
G° : makes things go round and hit each other...
TimeTravel_0 : Which will evaporate very quickly.
wyrmkin_37 : one in texas?
TimeTravel_0 : and create a massive ammount of X-ray and Gamma rays.
TimeTravel_0 : It will puzzle them for a while.
TimeTravel_0 : Until they figure out how to add and elcrtical charge and 
capture these strange odd and massive particles in a magnetic field.
wyrmkin_37 : they shoot electrons at the speed of light.......see what
they 
bust up into
TimeTravel_0 : Yes.
G° : still with you...
wyrmkin_37 : quarks
TimeTravel_0 : If you bombard a singularity with electrons...
TimeTravel_0 : you can alter the size of its event horizon.
TimeTravel_0 : and thus its gravitational field.
TimeTravel_0 : By overlapping these fileds from two singularities...
TimeTravel_0 : you can travel forward and backward through time.
TimeTravel_0 : Its actuallyu quyite simple.
wyrmkin_37 : i follow now
TimeTravel_0 : Thats noit the hard part.
G° : didn&#39;t tipler say there was no event horizon?
TimeTravel_0 : No..he said it was possible to approach a massive 
gravitationl field from certain angles and not get squished.
G° : oh, sorry
wyrmkin_37 : lol
TimeTravel_0 : Actually...Im not really a physisit.
G° : but you know all about this stuff... is that why you were picked?
TimeTravel_0 : I specialize in 20th century history and my grandfather 
builds computers.
wyrmkin_37 : what base?
TimeTravel_0 : Hmmm....you drive a car and know how to change the oil
don;t 
you?
TimeTravel_0 : I am based in Tampa Fl.
G° : actually, only just.. LOL
wyrmkin_37 : chas, afb
TimeTravel_0 : McDill
wyrmkin_37 : kewl
G° : sorry?
G° : in english?
wyrmkin_37 : zoomies
Yareisa : thats english?!
G° : you airforce wyrm?
wyrmkin_37 : yes
G° : your not working on a time machine are you?
G° : come here for guidance...
wyrmkin_37 : no just came in for chat
TimeTravel_0 : Altering gravity is not the hard part.
G° : LOL
Yareisa : go on...
TimeTravel_0 : Detecting gravity is the hard part.
TimeTravel_0 : I will tell you a littlke story.
TimeTravel_0 : When time travel was invented.
TimeTravel_0 : They built prototypes that would go back in time for a
split 
second and then return.
TimeTravel_0 : They had sensors and cameras on them.
TimeTravel_0 : ...and they never returned.
G° : and forwards as well? how about a single jump forwards?
TimeTravel_0 : It was later discovered that the machines were ending up 
about 15 miles away and 3000 fett in the air.
TimeTravel_0 : feet
G° : doh!
TimeTravel_0 : The Earth was rotating away from them.
wyrmkin_37 : synchroniaztion please
TimeTravel_0 : A system had to be invented that would &quot;hold&quot; the machine
to 
the Earth.
TimeTravel_0 : Its called VGL.
TimeTravel_0 : Its based on very sensative clocks and gravity sensors.
TimeTravel_0 : It stops the time distortion machine if radical changes in 
gravity are detected.
wyrmkin_37 : mechanical or electronic clocks
TimeTravel_0 : You wouldn&#39;t want to end up inside a mountain or under 
water...would you?
TimeTravel_0 : Cesium.
wyrmkin_37 : oh
G° : isn&#39;t all this classified? surely your suppoed to keep it secret
whilst 
in the past?
TimeTravel_0 : LOL!!!
TimeTravel_0 : I know you think Im nuts...come on.
TimeTravel_0 : Who would believe me?
G° : just asking?
TimeTravel_0 : It my best defense.
wyrmkin_37 : isnt celsium a higher class of quartz? dont know
G° : but we don&#39;t have long to find out if you are or not
TimeTravel_0 : Besides...do you know how big a hole 2 sigularites make
when 
their magnetic filed colpases?
G° : won&#39;t be long before CERN (?) make the discovery
TimeTravel_0 : Thats right.
G° : no
TimeTravel_0 : Welll....either do I.  But I don;t want to know.
G° : LOL
wyrmkin_37 : i read omni since it came out and i do want to know
G° : maybe I&#39;ll pass on the theory to someone who does their own
experiment 
and... BANG!
wyrmkin_37 : lol
TimeTravel_0 : I&#39;ve been trying.
G° : any joy?
TimeTravel_0 : But Im the crazy yank
wyrmkin_37 : lmao
G° : What do you expect? you didn&#39;t tell them you from the future did you?
TimeTravel_0 : You might be interested in this...
G° : if you really wanted to, you should have just passed on the theory
G° : go on....
TimeTravel_0 : Its very hard to convince someone you travel in time unless 
you&#39;re related to them.
G° : or know something that will happen...
TimeTravel_0 : Good point...but you&#39;de be surprised.
G° : not that I&#39;m asking you to tell me something, cos I don&#39;t want you to
TimeTravel_0 : They usually think its your fault.
G° : LOL
G° : bummer...
wyrmkin_37 : very interesting
TimeTravel_0 : That&#39;s why I love these chat rooms.
wyrmkin_37 : me too
TimeTravel_0 : I know that nothing I say will make a bit of difference.
wyrmkin_37 : i can drink my jack and coke and learn a few things
G° : not true.. this is the place where you can make a difference.
TimeTravel_0 : Im not feeling sorry for myself.
TimeTravel_0 : Im actually learning to like the people here.
TimeTravel_0 : You have a very bad reputaion in 2036.
wyrmkin_37 : TT........who me?
TimeTravel_0 : lol...in general.
wyrmkin_37 : heard that
G° : how about those 80&#39;s lot though. they must be worse...
TimeTravel_0 : Don&#39;t get me started.
G° : LOL
TimeTravel_0 : At least your commercials and video games have gotten
beeter 
through the years.
G° : and as for the 70&#39;s! Sheesh!
wyrmkin_37 : 60&#39;s were cool
TimeTravel_0 : Generaly... this period is thought of as the time when they 
had it all and squanderd it.
TimeTravel_0 : You diserve your fate.
wyrmkin_37 : but fun was had
TimeTravel_0 : That&#39;s true.
TimeTravel_0 : Can I ask you brits a question?
G° : sure
Yareisa : yeah sure
G° : shoot
TimeTravel_0 : When I was a kid...back in 2012...
G° : a good year for cyberpunk...
TimeTravel_0 : I used to watch a DVD called UFO that was made in England.
TimeTravel_0 : Ever heard of it?
G° : oops no, that was 2030, sorry
G° : the tv series? 70&#39;s?
wyrmkin_37 : i saw it on regular tv
TimeTravel_0 : Yes!!!
TimeTravel_0 : You&#39;ve seen it?
Yareisa : oh yes I remember that one
TimeTravel_0 : Wow...we do have something in common.
G° : yeah, dreadful outfits!
TimeTravel_0 : No one has heard of it here.
Yareisa : straker wasn&#39;t it
G° : and hairstyles!
TimeTravel_0 : I loved that show!
G° : so TT, there is something you can tell me
TimeTravel_0 : Yes?
G° : what happens in December 2012?
wyrmkin_37 : i saw it the good guys were called shadow?
G° : anything?
TimeTravel_0 : Ahhh..the acient miayn prohecies.
G° : the very same
TimeTravel_0 : _wyrmkin_37 : mayans
TimeTravel_0 : sorry
wyrmkin_37 : ?
TimeTravel_0 : Nothing happens...but there is a nuclear war in 2015.
G° : bugger
TimeTravel_0 : Its not that bad.
TimeTravel_0 : The bombs are much cleaner.
G° : i guess not
wyrmkin_37 : china and russia?
TimeTravel_0 : There&#39;s a civial war in the US.
wyrmkin_37 : whoa?
TimeTravel_0 : Russian launches against China, Europe and the US.
G° : it was bound to happen sooner or later...
TimeTravel_0 : Can;t you see it coming?
G° : whatamistaka to maka!
TimeTravel_0 : Does anyone read history anymore?
wyrmkin_37 : i saw russia and china but not usa
TimeTravel_0 : From my point of view...Russia helps us.  We win.
G° : how so?
TimeTravel_0 : But Im a little pissed right now.  Is that still the right 
word?
wyrmkin_37 : wheat, money........lets make friends
G° : ?
TimeTravel_0 : The civil war in the US has two sides.
TimeTravel_0 : I fought on one side.
G° : they usualy do
wyrmkin_37 : proceed sir................
TimeTravel_0 : The other side got nuked by Russia.
G° : i see
G° : not north and south again was it?
TimeTravel_0 : In 2036, they are our largets trading partner.
TimeTravel_0 : No...more like city angainst country.&#39;
wyrmkin_37 : majorities against minorities.......
TimeTravel_0 : Yes.
TimeTravel_0 : You know...guns versus no guns.
TimeTravel_0 : Power versus no power.
wyrmkin_37 : time to pour another jack and coke
TimeTravel_0 : Un troops versus no UN troops.
G° : well, it&#39;s been interesting talking to you John, but it&#39;s way past my 
bedtime...
Yareisa : what...I&#39;ve been up 24 hours!
TimeTravel_0 : Sleep well.
TimeTravel_0 : Youve been very polite.
G° : look me up when you get back to 2036 will you?
TimeTravel_0 : I will try.
G° : if i&#39;m still here
TimeTravel_0 : Go north.
TimeTravel_0 : Invest in hydrogen fuel cells
G° : goodnight Yareisa
Yareisa : goodnight G
Yareisa : thanks for staying up so early!
G° : thanks again TT, goodnight
G° : LOL
TimeTravel_0 : good night
G° : see you again soon
Yareisa : yup
TimeTravel_0 : Ill be here
TimeTravel_0 : Think up some good questions
G° puts on his coat and trudges out...
Yareisa : bye G
8G° has left the conversation.
Yareisa : I&#39;ve given up going to bed now, might as well keep going!
TimeTravel_0 : Time is relative.
TimeTravel_0 : But sleep....
Yareisa : forgotten what sleep is!
TimeTravel_0 : What do you do for a living?
Yareisa : by day...web site design
TimeTravel_0 : Is your family close to you?
Yareisa : no
TimeTravel_0 : That&#39;s the one thing I will never understand about this
time.
Yareisa : whats that
TimeTravel_0 : Don;t you feel alone without them?
Yareisa : not really, I&#39;m used to being alone
TimeTravel_0 : Its very diffrent in the future.
TimeTravel_0 : I can&#39;t imagine being without my family.
TimeTravel_0 : I don;t know if I should pity or admire you.
Yareisa : I&#39;m not sure either!
8wyrmkin_37 has returned.
Yareisa : wb
wyrmkin_37 : hello folks
TimeTravel_0 : greetings
Yareisa : I am known as a Warrior, I&#39;m used to fighting to survive
wyrmkin_37 : been there
TimeTravel_0 : In the future, life is organized around the family.
wyrmkin_37 : good
TimeTravel_0 : and the community.
Yareisa : then it looks like I have a problem!
TimeTravel_0 : &#39;I can;t imagine what it&#39;s like to live alone.
Yareisa : I rather like it actually
TimeTravel_0 : If I may ask...why?
Yareisa : I can do what I choose, when I choose without having to answer
to 
anyone
TimeTravel_0 : What about it appeals to you?
wyrmkin_37 : later folks
8wyrmkin_37 has left the conversation.
TimeTravel_0 : good night
Yareisa : Sometimes I miss not having company
Yareisa : but I&#39;m very independant
TimeTravel_0 : Your answer is typical of the people of your time.
TimeTravel_0 : Do you feel you would be hindered by &quot;answerinfg? to
someone?
TimeTravel_0 : What does that mean?
Yareisa : I was hindered, that is why I evicted my husband
TimeTravel_0 : Please explain.
Yareisa : I am a deeply spiritual person, I needed to grow, to expand, and 
he stopped me
TimeTravel_0 : How...if its not too personal.
Yareisa : he was a control freak, I had to do what he told me to do etc
TimeTravel_0 : I think you would like the future.
Yareisa : why is that
TimeTravel_0 : Its a common complainyt that people feel hindered.
TimeTravel_0 : In the future, life is more challenging.
Yareisa : is it more spiritual?
TimeTravel_0 : There is little room for petty problems.
TimeTravel_0 : Yes!
TimeTravel_0 : Mystery returns to existance.
Yareisa : beyond the human
TimeTravel_0 : There are fewer luxuries but life is more enjoyable.
Yareisa : I never like luxuries anyway
Yareisa : I live basically
Yareisa : do you consider yourself human
TimeTravel_0 : I wish I could show you the time machine and give you hope.
TimeTravel_0 : Yes.
TimeTravel_0 : I am very different from you.
Yareisa : in what way
TimeTravel_0 : My life is very different.
TimeTravel_0 : I harbor a ccertain ammount of anger toward this time.
Yareisa : why
TimeTravel_0 : I see an entire population of people who are sleeping.
TimeTravel_0 : I fell in love once and she passed away.
TimeTravel_0 : I blame you for her death.
Yareisa : why
TimeTravel_0 : She died of brain cancer.
TimeTravel_0 : You may find this interesting.
TimeTravel_0 : WHen I was training for &quot;time travel&quot;...
TimeTravel_0 : ...a great deal of what we did was pyscholgical training.
TimeTravel_0 : In one of our exercises...we had to go back in time and 
convince &quot;ourselves&quot; to do something we regretted not doing in our own
life.
TimeTravel_0 : I told myself to get married before she died.
TimeTravel_0 : SOmething I was unable to do.
TimeTravel_0 : I hate you for that.
Yareisa : hate me personally?
TimeTravel_0 : Sorry.... I don;t hate you.
TimeTravel_0 : I mean this time.
TimeTravel_0 : Jacksonville Fl took a direct hit.
TimeTravel_0 : The radiation killed her.
Yareisa : I cannot say sorry for something that hasn&#39;t happened yet, but I 
am sorry
TimeTravel_0 : I talk too much
Yareisa : and I don&#39;t talk enough
TimeTravel_0 : I just wish things didn;t have to happen athey way they
will.
Yareisa : we cannot change it?
TimeTravel_0 : Its too late.
Yareisa : I sensed that
TimeTravel_0 : I regret what you could have been bot what will result.
TimeTravel_0 : not
TimeTravel_0 : ...are you drinking?
Yareisa : no
TimeTravel_0 : I am... orange wine.
TimeTravel_0 : I love it.
Yareisa : I think my ethereal has taken over, my body has no need for 
anything more
TimeTravel_0 : Are you alone?
Yareisa : yes
TimeTravel_0 : No children?
Yareisa : none
TimeTravel_0 : Are you afraid?
Yareisa : what of
TimeTravel_0 : Being alone?
Yareisa : no
TimeTravel_0 : I don;t mean to be so perosnal.
TimeTravel_0 : I aplogoze.
Yareisa : its alright, I&#39;m used to it
TimeTravel_0 : To being alone?
Yareisa : to being asked personal questions as well!
TimeTravel_0 : I appreciate your kindness.
Yareisa : ty, but that is my nature
TimeTravel_0 : I am familiar with Blue Oyster Cult.
Yareisa : oh, you&#39;ve read my profile?!
TimeTravel_0 : I just took a look.
TimeTravel_0 : In fact...my father is a big fan.
Yareisa : the link to my web site is on there too
Yareisa : one of my favourite tracks is, Veterans of the Psychic Wars
TimeTravel_0 : Thats quite a webb ste...hold on.
Yareisa : k
TimeTravel_0 : Im asking my father.
TimeTravel_0 : He says thats from &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;?
Yareisa : I&#39;ve got it on a compilation, Workshop of the Telescopes
TimeTravel_0 : &quot;Cultosaurus Erectus&quot; is his favorite.
TimeTravel_0 : I have no idea what he&#39;s taling about.
Yareisa : probably best not to, might cause a glitch in the space time 
contimuum!
TimeTravel_0 : Godzillia?
Yareisa : yes thats a good one
TimeTravel_0 : Hes lauging.
TimeTravel_0 : You wacky 20th century freaks.
Yareisa : Don&#39;t Fear The Reaper is good too, a classic
Yareisa : so do I presume the aliens don&#39;t come in 2012 then?
TimeTravel_0 : Noty that Im aware of.
TimeTravel_0 : However...there are plenty of things that will get your 
attention by 2012.
Yareisa : such as...can you say?
TimeTravel_0 : My father has a question.
Yareisa : go on
TimeTravel_0 : What do you think of &quot;club Ninja&quot;?  I have no idea what
that 
is.
Yareisa : I haven&#39;t heard that one
Yareisa : I&#39;ve got Dancing in the ruins on the compilation
TimeTravel_0 : He says it was one of their last CDs.
Yareisa : yes, then there is Imaginos
Yareisa : I&#39;ve just started to collect them again, used to have some
albums, 
getting CD&#39;s now
TimeTravel_0 : Revolutoin by night?  What&#39;s that.
Yareisa : another album
TimeTravel_0 : I see.
TimeTravel_0 : Perhaps you should talk to my father.
Yareisa : I could get confused!
Yareisa : Actually, I will have to go soon, its nearly 6 in the morning 
here...
Yareisa : I got up at 5 in the morning on Friday
TimeTravel_0 : I hope to talk to yoiu again.
Yareisa : I would like that
TimeTravel_0 : Cheer up.
TimeTravel_0 : Things get better.
TimeTravel_0 : Get some sleep.
Yareisa : I will!
TimeTravel_0 : Good night.
Yareisa : good night
