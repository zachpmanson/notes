    <article><p>I recently received access to DALL-E and played around with it for a while. The interface is simple, just a textbox and a few curated images to give you some inspiration.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/dall-e.jpg" /></p>
<p>Once you submit a prompt to DALL-E, you are shown more curated images and their corresponding prompts while your request is processed.</p>
<p>DALL-E is capable of producing some amazing images. It takes a bit of warming up, but after little practice I was able to create wonderful and bizarre generative art. Despite this, I felt I didn't know how to produce something as interesting or engaging as their curated images the presented to me when using DALL-E. I could logically understand that the tool had potential, but I felt separated from it.</p>
<p>Using Midjourney is completely a different experience. Midjourney currently runs its generative art AI through a bot on their company Discord server. You generate images by typing in a command in certain channels, and all the images produced are visible to everyone on the server simultaneously. Before you can even type something you are assaulted by an unfiltered, non-curated array of incredible images, all diffusing right before your eyes.</p>

<p>While both generators are impressive, using Midjourney was a visceral experience for me in a way that DALL-E was not. DALL-E is sipping a glass of water, Midjourney is a firehose blasting your face. I was immediately in awe.</p>
<p>The design of Midjourney makes it abundantly clear how big an impact this technology will have on the world. Watching hundreds of strangers generate images in real-time is jaw dropping. I was mesmerised, and within minutes saw images that moved me, despite being created by an AI without any intention behind them.</p>
<p>While I am sure both of these are the future, only one made me feel it.</p>
