            <description>LibKey Nomad's Stolen Valour</description>
            
            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p>There is a wonderful browser extension with an awful name made by Third Iron called <a href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-nomad/">LibKey Nomad</a>. It allows university staff and students gain access to academic journals that your univesity is subscribed to without logging in or requesting access. You install the extension, sign in with your university credentials, and then it just works. Whenever you are on a site that LibKey Nomad is automatically allowing you access to, it displays this little banner in the corner of the page.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/proper-popup.png" /></p>
<p>You click it and you are taken direct to the paper. It really streamlines the process for a lot of sites.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/wikipedia-popup.png" /></p>
<p>It hilariously appears on Wikipedia articles, as if the University of Western Australia has been incredibly gracious by allowing me to see Wikipedia. The reasoning here is that access to (at least one of) the citations is being provided through LibKey Nomad, but this makes the banner no less obnoxious.</p>
<p>The banner doesn't even have a function like it does on other journals, clicking it just takes you to the references list.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/citations.png" /></p>
<p>Wikipedia is one of the most impressive things humans have created. Keep your banners to yourself, Third Iron.</p>]]>

            <description>How German monks broke my website</description>
            
            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p>I received a <a href="https://github.com/pavo-etc/penultimate-guitar/issues/41">strange bug report</a> on <a href="/penultimate-guitar">Penultimate Guitar</a> where the Next.js rendering would fail completely on certain songs.</p>
<h2 id="the-error">The Error</h2>
<p>The type error was being triggered by a chord component, where the key was undefined. The chords are pulled from Ultimate Guitar, so I inspected the JSON payload from the <a href="https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1684995">original source</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/ug.png" /></p>
<p>Why the hell is there a <code>[ch]H[/ch]</code> chord in there? That's definitely the cause as I never accounted for non-existent keys. Looking at Ultimate Guitar, it renders as a B chord.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/ug-rendered.png" /></p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<details>
<summary>An aside on Ultimate Guitar HTML</summary>
<p>The way Ultimate Guitar handles data is bizarre. It passes a static dehydrated HTML page to the client.  The data payload is in the HTML as well, but instead of being contained in a <code>script</code> tag it's a giant JSON payload in an escaped string within an attribute of a random <code>div</code></p>
</details>
<h2 id="one-google-search-later">One Google Search Later</h2>
<p>Germany and the Netherlands ha(d/ve) their own musical key notation that include(d/s) a H chord. <a href="https://www.guitarsite.com/newsletters/010122/12.shtml">This site</a> claims it ended in "1994/1995", though I've seen <a href="https://github.com/pavo-etc/penultimate-guitar/issues/41#issuecomment-1538452351">other</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/8rn0ve">sources</a> claim its still taught this way. This comes as an artifact of the bizarre history Western music notation, which is a problem I seem to keep running into recently in my attempts to learn more about music theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned in music school that the chord is called "B" (like in the rest of the world), but the note is called "H" (eg. the C Major scale would be C, D, E, F, G, A, H, C).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>TobTobXX, who reported the bug</cite></p>
<h2 id="western-musics-stupid-origins">Western Music's Stupid Origins</h2>
<p>Western music is based on ecclesiastic modes used in church in the early Middle Ages, which only used the diatonic notes of the C scale (<em>natural</em> notes). The musical notation systems of the time reflected this, not accounting for notes outside of the C scale. When sharps and flats later came into more common use, the existing notation systems needed a way to distinguish them from the natural notes they sat between.</p>
<p>This problem first arose with B natural and B flat, according to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/musical-expression">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>. The first method of distinguishing B from B flat was using two different forms of the lowercase "b" character:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/The-Flat-Sharp-And-Natural-A-Historical-Sketch.png" /></p>
<p>Niecks, Frederick. “The Flat, Sharp, and Natural. A Historical Sketch.” <em>Proceedings of the Musical Association</em>, vol. 16, 1889, pp. 79–100.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line in Germany, monks transcribing these square and round "b" characters confused the squared "b" for "h", and this was later assumed to be intentional. "H" became a convention for writing B natural, while the "b" character remained convention for writing B flat. "B" and "b" became amalgamated, both coming to represent modern B flat.</p>
<p>In the rest of the world, this "H" note didn't catch on.</p>
<p>In time, notation for sharp and flat notes other than B flat was needed. This use of square and round "b" to denote B and B flat eventually evolved into our modern notation for indicating natural and non-natural, <em>accidentals</em>. ♭ comes from the round "b", while ♯ and ♮ come from the square "b".</p>
<p>Somehow, Germany still hasn't fully corrected this mistake, continuing to use "H" to represent B natural and many places. Including Ultimate Guitar. Ugh.</p>
<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<p>I don't love dealing with problems caused by the whims of millenia dead monks, but this was an interesting rabbit hole to fall into. The issue has since been patched, and I look forward to my mistakes ruining someone's day in 3023.</p>

<details>
<summary> An aside on The Flat, Sharp, and Natural. A Historical Sketch </summary>
<p>When I first copied the text from the article, it copied that "square b" as a "h". Funny that modern OCR technology makes the same mistakes at 1000 year old monks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first known writer who distinguished between b natural and b flat was Odo of Clugny, who died in 942 ; the b natural being indicated by a square b (h), the b flat by a round b (b)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also a pain in the ass to find a copy of that article. It's mostly found on paywalled academic sites despite the article definitely being out of copyright. Luckily the Internet Archive <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/work/3jdud373effq3e376gqtlkxqvq">has a copy</a>.</p>

            <title>The Curse of the Last Good Day</title>
            <link>https://notes.zachmanson.com/the-curse-of-the-last-good-day</link>
            
            <description>Spoilers for The Fault in Our Stars, I guess</description>
            
            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> describes the phenomenon of the Last Good Day, a concept that has been echoing in my head ever since I read the book in high school. In the novel, the Last Good Day is the final time a person who is slowly deteriorating has a peaceful and pleasant moment with those around them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no way of knowing that your last good day is Your Last Good Day. At the time, it is just another good day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story presents this in the context of Augustus' worsening condition and eventual death.</p>
<p>So far, I've been lucky enough to be free of facing slow health declines in myself and those close to me, but the concept of the Last Good Day has sat quietly in the back of my mind since first encountering it. Whenever I have some kind of impending loss, no matter how small, my thoughts tend to orbit around it.</p>
<p>With my bachelor's degree coming to a close soon, lots of my friends are moving away for careers or further study in other countries. The groups that have formed won't continue to exist in the way the have for the last 3 years. Not everyone is leaving of course and no one person is single load-bearing pillar of the group, but buildings tend not to handle losing half their supports.</p>
<p>I've been aware that this will happen for months, and at every group event in my head I'm constantly thinking <em>Is this going to be the Last Good Day? Is this Good enough? Can I make this better?</em> This is definitely not healthy and definitely doesn't help me enjoy the limited time left with my friends. This line of thinking is something I hesitate to even talk about with my friends in fear of inspiring the same kind of thought spirals in their minds.</p>
<p>Time has gone on and the erosion has begun. As I write this, another will be flying to Sydney tomorrow morning. Enough friends have left now that the Last Good Day has certainly passed, and yet I'm still not 100% sure which day it was. There's some strong contenders though.</p>
<p>That's life, I know I'll make more friends and there's no need to be melodramatic. Regardless, I'm going to miss this period and the people I've spent it with.</p>
<p>Cheers and auld lang syne and so on.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>I did my <a href="/computer-science">Computer Science</a> degree from 2020 to 2023, coming out with a BSc. Computer Science, Cybersecurity, minoring in Data Science.  I have omitted statistics units because I have nothing intelligible to say about them.</p>
<p>Just do <a href="https://codersforcauses.org/">Coders For Causes</a>, you will learn more in that than entire semesters of this degree. <strong>Learn how to use <a href="/git">git</a> as fast as possible</strong> then force all your group project members to use it. Narrow down your problems as much as possible, then google the most generic possible description of it. If you see someone using semicolons mid-sentence regularly it's probably <a href="/christ-mcdonald">Chris McDonald</a>.</p>

<h2 id="first-year-units">First Year Units</h2>
<p>CITS1001 Software Engineering with Java (called Object Oriented Programming when I took it in 2020):</p>
<ul>
<li>serves as the introduction to programming for many students</li>
<li>actively bad introduction to programming</li>
<li>spends time describing the conceptual model of objects and encapsulation before describing variables and if statements</li>
<li>class only uses BlueJ (yuck) and as such never teaches you to use a main function. Met students who had completed the class and were still incapable of actually running a Java program</li>
<li>glad that it is being replaced with CITS2005</li>
</ul>
<p>CITS1003 Intro to Cybersecurity:</p>
<ul>
<li>extremely fun introduction to basic cybersecurity concepts</li>

<ul>
<li>much better intro to programming</li>
<li>weirdly speedruns 2 years of Computer Science ATAR in the first lesson for no reason</li>

<li>challenging projects but you learn a lot</li>
<li>very rewarding</li>
<li>this and CITS2200 have the highest kill rate for comsci degrees <sup>[citation needed]</sup>. partially because they are hard, partially because the previous units did a pretty bad job preparing students for them</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>actual waste of time</li>
<li>you can learn this entire unit in a day but watching some tutorials on matplotlib, numpy and pandas</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="third-year-units">Third Year Units</h2>
<p>CITS3001 Algorithms, Agents &amp; Artificial Intelligence</p>

<li>Very interesting content, well taught</li>
<li>projects get your hands dirty with creating actual protocols and working with sockets</li>
<li>few things were more satifying in the entire degree than actually running my final project for this over the internet between me and my partners houses and watching it run</li>
<li>spiritual sequel to Systems Programming</li>
</ul>
<p>CITS3003 Graphics and Animation</p>
<ul>
<li>abandoned</li>
<li>feels like it was really interesting in 2009, but the unit coordinator who cared about it has since left and now it wanders the optional units lists like a zombie</li>
<li>project hasn't changed majorly in 10 years, though it has gotten more convoluted</li>
<li>there are certainly past versions of it on github if you are so inclined</li>
<li>soulless, out of date, and wasted potential as it could be one of the most interesting units</li>
</ul>
<p>CITS3006 Penetration Testing</p>
<ul>
<li>amazing</li>
<li>final assessment is literally break into this VM, then secure it and swap with other groups</li>
<li>good balance of pratical and theoretical</li>
<li>Jin Hong is fantastic</li>
<li>lab instructors are all great</li>
<li>had one lecture that wasn't allowed to be recorded because it taught actual live vulnerabilities in UWA systems, excellent, all units should have one of these</li>

<li>there are lectures</li>
<li>2/10 lectures will be valuable</li>
<li>3/10 will be companies hyping themselves up</li>
<li>4/10 will be inane ethics bullshit</li>
<li>1/10 will be alleged war criminals</li>
<li>all prior units have not adequately prepared you for this, go learn django or <a href="/react">react</a> because you are very likely going to need to know these. if you are wondering if you should make a web app you should probably just make a web app</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-advice">Miscellaneous Advice</h2>
<p>Labs are the only thing in the degree you can't get from youtube or the <a href="/internet">internet</a>. If you are bad, actually do the labs, go in and ask the instructors questions. It's annoying but they can help you bridge the gap between trash and passing.</p>
<p>Learn how to use the command line ASAP. Learn git. Seriously go learn git. So many people I met couldn't use git in their third year. How they made it that far sending code snippets over discord is beyond me. Bully everyone you know into using git. You will actually lose 20% mark if you don't use git+github for a group project because you will waste so much time trying to coordinate the project. If git is hurting your brain try using GitHub Desktop which makes it a bit easier to use for newcomers.</p>
<p>Have other hobbies. Doesn't matter what they are but gaming doesn't count if it's your only hobby.</p>
<p>Go to social events with clubs. The specific club doesn't matter, they are all fine. Alcohol helps, if you are so inclined (science union pub crawls are great). It's very easy in computer science to not make actually make any friends and do everything online. But you will need friends to not be sad and die alone.</p>]]>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This hEP proposes a framework for adding first-class support for additional forms of h used in mathematical contexts, and that "𝐡" be added to the h programming language standard implementation. As of version 1.0, the only supported output characters are "h" and "'".</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The h Programming language is borne from <a href="https://christine.website/blog/formal-grammar-of-h-2019-05-19">the conlang h</a> which was formalised in 2019 by Xe Iaso.</p>
<p>In their unveiling of the language they exhibited how the conlang's simple syntax could be used for complex conversation, all within the use of a single written character and phone:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;Cadey&gt; h
&lt;DoesntGetIt&gt; h h h h
* Cadey facepalms
</code></pre></div>
<p>As stated in h's formal specification, it can be used to represent all possible communications within the confines of the letter h.</p>
<p>They later developed a syntax, compiler and runtime for <a href="https://christine.website/blog/h-language-2019-06-30">the h Programming Language</a> (hlang). This programming language was designed for the output of the h conlang, and expanded the character set in use to include both the Romanic form "h" and its Lojbanic equivalent "'".</p>
<p>A long-standing difficulty for the programming language is expressing mathematical notation in its output. While it is entirely possible to express any and all equations in the language, for this purpose it doesn't utiltise the "h" character to its maximum capacity and as such is unnecessarily verbose.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>The primary goals of this proposal are to provide a specification for implementing additional forms of "h" in hlang to enable more terse output for use in mathematical contexts. The only additional form of "h" proposed in this hEP is "𝐡" (U+1D421).</p>
<p>The proposal would enable programs such as this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>cat<span class="w"> </span>new_equation.h
𝐡<span class="w"> </span>𝐡<span class="w"> </span>h<span class="w"> </span><span class="err">&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>AST this would generate during compilation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>H(&quot;𝐡 𝐡 h &#39;&quot;)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Program output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>𝐡 𝐡 h &#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is an improvement over the existing implementation, which would require the much longer and more cumbersome hlang 1.0 source to produce the equivalent equation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>cat<span class="w"> </span>old_equation.h
h<span class="w"> </span>h<span class="w"> </span>h<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39; &#39;</span><span class="w"> </span>h<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39; h h h h h h h h h &#39;</span><span class="w"> </span>h
</code></pre></div>
<p>Translating this from h (conlang) to English:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>a^2 + b^2 = c^2
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="non-goals">Non-Goals</h2>
<p>This hEP is not an attempt to sully hlang with characters outside of the formal grammar of the h conlang. The scope of the specification, while allowing for additional forms of "h" to be supported, is exclusively for forms of "h". It is not applicable to other characters, such as "g".</p>
<p>This hEP only explicitly proposes the addition of "𝐡" (U+1D421) though is designed to allow other forms of "h" to be supported by hlang in the future, such as "𝒉" (U+1D489), "𝓱" (U+1D4F1), or "𝕙" (U+1D559). While these forms could be implemented in a near identical manner to "𝐡", that is outside of the scope of this hEP. All of these forms of "h" are UTF-8 characters designed for use in mathematical equations.</p>
<p>The hEP is also explicitly not intending to enable support for "h" with diacritics, such as "ḧ" (U+1E27). Etymologically related forms of modern "h" are also outside the scope of this hEP.</p>
<h2 id="semantics">Semantics</h2>
<p>Under this proposal, "𝐡" would receive first class support by hlang. To output it would be the same as the standard "h" character:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>cat<span class="w"> </span>math_h.h
𝐡
</code></pre></div>
<p>Produced AST:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>H(𝐡)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>𝐡
</code></pre></div>
<p>Represented with a node tree:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&amp;peg.Node{
    Name: &quot;H&quot;,
    Text: &quot;𝐡&quot;,
    Kids: nil,
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The node tree for the earlier Pythagorean example would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&amp;peg.Node{
    Name: &quot;H&quot;,
    Text: &quot;𝐡 𝐡 h &#39;&quot;,
    Kids: {
        &amp;peg.Node{
            Name: &quot;&quot;,
            Text: &quot;𝐡&quot;,
            Kids: nil,
        },
        &amp;peg.Node{
            Name: &quot;&quot;,
            Text: &quot;𝐡&quot;,
            Kids: nil,
        },
        &amp;peg.Node{
            Name: &quot;&quot;,
            Text: &quot;h&quot;,
            Kids: nil,
        },
        &amp;peg.Node{
            Name: &quot;&quot;,
            Text: &quot;&#39;&quot;,
            Kids: nil,
        },
    },
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The "𝐡" character should be usable in all contexts where "h" and "'" are currently usable. Grammatically it should follow all the same principles and restrictions as "h" and "'".</p>

<p>As with hlang v1.0, this proposal not require any dependencies, other than UTF-8 formatted source files.</p>

<p>Much like how ruby+rspec is very well suited to test driven development, many frameworks are well suited to SDD.  Whichever framework you know is the ideal framework for SDD.  Time is of the essence and you have no-one to please but yourself.  Spite burns hot but it burns dirty, and it is not a renewable resource.  Your must strike while the iron is hot and complete the project before you are sapped of the hatred that caused you to start the project.</p>]]>

            <title>Spotify Design Decisions</title>
            <link>https://notes.zachmanson.com/spotify-design-decisions</link>
            
            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p>This page is a list of design decisions made by Spotify that I consider shitty.  I'm sure some of them only A/B tested, coming and going silently, but some have lingered for years. In any case I have experienced (have been subjected to) all of these personally and they piss me off greatly.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/work/dear-spotify/">Dear spotify product manager</a> by Lu Wilson</p>
<h2 id="smart-shuffle-button-cycle-lock">Smart Shuffle Button Cycle Lock</h2>
<p>Spotify has added a feature called Smart Shuffle that works like normal shuffling, but also added recommended songs in-between ever few tracks in the queue.  On paper I like this feature, though I have never found myself actually using it. I was introduced to it through the following infuriating UX.</p>
<p>I go the the Now Playing screen on the Android Spotify client. The playlist I am listening to is currently set to shuffle (regular shuffle), but I would like to turn off regular shuffle.  I press the button with a shuffle icon, which has for 10+ years been a single toggle that would instantly take effect.  Instead of a simple 2 option toggle, I find that it has been converted in to a 3 option cycle button, where pressing it cycles through the options of <code>Linear -&gt; Shuffle -&gt; Smart Shuffle -&gt; Linear</code>.  I can see the thinking behind this decision though I don't like it since it breaks muscle memory established by this app for a decade and all other music playing applications.  That is not my issue though.</p>
<p>When you click the button and move the state from <code>Shuffle</code> to <code>Smart Shuffle</code>, the application begins loading the Smart Shuffle recommendations which means it must query Spotify servers, which is an operation that takes multiple seconds.  While this occurs, the button with a Shuffle icon becomes a button with a loading spinner, and becomes unclickable. I must wait multiple seconds before I can turn off Smart Shuffle.</p>
<p><code>Linear -&gt; Shuffle -&gt; Loading (multiple seconds) -&gt; Smart Shuffle -&gt; Linear</code></p>
<p>This is deeply infuriating.  I never even wanted to use Smart Shuffle in the first place and now I must wait for it.</p>
<p>This occurred every time I wanted to turn off  <code>Shuffle</code>.  Which is a lot.</p>
<p>As of 2024-01-21, this loading state of the button appears to have been removed, but the button still is a 3 option cycle which I dislike (though respect the elegance of).</p>
<h2 id="overflow-menu-loading">Overflow Menu Loading</h2>
<p>For some godforsaken reason, the overflow menu for a track sometimes appears to require a network request before it can show.  If this request is slow, it will show a loading spinner in place of the menu, until the server responds.  Or in some cases, the <strong>overflow menu will fail to load entirely</strong>.  This is insane, since for the most part, the options on this menu are identical.  This is doubly insane since the menu can load without any issue what-so-ever in offline mode.</p>
<p>I have only ever experienced this issue on the Android mobile app, which for many years did not support swiping on a song to queue a song.  At this time you were only able to queue a song. through the overflow menu, which often times meant waiting multiple seconds for menu to appear.  God forbid you wanting to queue multiple songs in a row. Thankfully you can now bypass the menu loading by swiping a track to the right.</p>
<p>Oh wait!</p>
<h2 id="cant-swipe-to-queue-on-blend-playlists">Can't Swipe to Queue on Blend Playlists</h2>
<p>On Android you cannot swipe to queue a playlist if the playlist is a blend playlist??? Why would this screen use a different component to represent a list of songs to every other screen in the app? </p>
<video src='/media/blend-swiping.webm' controls></video>

<h2 id="secret-sliding-menu">Secret Sliding Menu</h2>
<p>This one I only just noticed now while typing this post. There is a sliding menu that appears if you click on your profile picture in the corner of any of the 3 main screens.  It seems a bit sparse, like it would be better suited to being a drop down? In any case this menu can actually be accessed from any playlist folder screen as well, despite there being no indication of this.  This only seems to work on playlist folder screens though, as it doesn't work for any other subpages.</p>
<p>This one was annoying as I accidentally triggered in when attempting to swipe in from the left to go back a screen.</p>
<video src='/media/sliding-menu.webm' controls></video>

<h2 id="cant-swipe-up-to-access-player">Can't Swipe Up to Access Player</h2>
<p>On Android you can swipe down on the player interface but you cannot swipe up to reveal it.  When you attempt this you will almost definitely skip the song that is currently playing, since the minimised version of the player only detects left and right swipes.</p>
<video src='/media/swipe-up.webm' controls></video>

<h2 id="unable-to-remove-dj-shortcut-on-desktop">Unable to Remove DJ Shortcut On Desktop</h2>
<p>On desktop they have added a link to the DJ feature at the top of Your Library, below pinned playlists.  Despite not being a playlist (nor a feature I use), it continues to appear even when you have set the filter to only show playlists.  As far as I know it cannot be removed?  But it can be pinned.  Despite already being permalocked to the top.
<img alt="" src="/media/dj.png" />
The day after writing the previous paragraph, I noticed they had added the DJ to the same section in the mobile app, but long pressing the DJ icon shows you an option to hide it, which seems to have hidden it on all my devices.  Why is this option not available in the desktop client!</p>
<h2 id="custom-playlist-sorting">Custom Playlist Sorting</h2>
<p>For as long as I can remember you can order the playlists you have created or followed in any order along the left side of the desktop app. You can even put them in nested folders which is fantastic.  I have many playlists organised into folders in particular orders.  I know how to get to the playlist I want quickly because I have put it in a particular place. This order and "Recently played" are the only two i would ever want.</p>
<p>Spotify seems to hate this use case.  To my knowledge its never been possible to rearrange order of playlists on the mobile app, only the desktop client.</p>
<p>When you attempt to add a song to playlist on mobile, there isn't even an option to sort by recently played anymore.  This is diametrically opposed to desktop, where the right click menu will ONLY allow you to sort by custom order. </p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Also known as shadow libraries, are potentially the best thing humans have ever created and are illegal in most places.  They are archives human writing, some catering to particular niches and some attempting to capture <em>everything</em>.  And then distribute all of human knowledge and writing for free.</p>
<p>They have no regard for copyright law, generally viewing them as part of a broken system or distractions to (what the pirate librarians might call) their noble goals.</p>
<p>Library Genesis (libgen) and Sci-Hub (a superset of libgen) focus primarily on academic materials, textbooks and journal publications.  The projects are borne from the goal of allowing access to documents that would normally only be accessible through expensive journals.</p>
<p>Books3 is another pirate library, containing ≈196000 books sourced from Bibliotik.  It is named in the spirit of OpenAI's dubiously sourced collections of books, Books1 and Books2.  Books3 has become well known for its use in training <a href="/large-language-models">large language models</a> like <a href="/llama">LLaMA</a>.</p>
<p>The Internet Archive is pirate library adjacent.  It contains and redistributes (without permission) countless copyrighted works, but will respond to takedown requests.</p>
<p>During <a href="/uwa-computer-science">my time at university</a>, use of Library Genesis and Sci-Hub was rife. While not everyone knew of these sites directly, everyone knew someone who knew someone who did, and textbook PDFs propagated on the sneakernet.</p>
<p>Pirate libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library Genesis</li>
<li>Sci-Hub</li>
<li>Bibliotik</li>
<li>Books3</li>
<li>Gigapedia</li>
<li>Kolkhoz</li>
<li>Librusec</li>
</ul>
<p>An adjacent concept is preservation of media, where pirated copies are seen as a defence against permanent loss. This is the thinking behind the Internet Archive and the sites it has inspired.  This kind of thinking is also prevalent in the world of video games, a medium where many works are rendered unavailable by missing online services, changing hardware landscape or lost source code. There are many cases where old games have been recovered or restored through pirated versions.</p>

            <title>Vercel Images Optimisation</title>
            <link>https://notes.zachmanson.com/vercel-images-optimisation</link>
            
            <description>A small footgun for beginners using Vercel.</description>
            
            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p>TLDR: If you are using Vercel and display a lot of images hosted on someone else's server, you probably want to turn off <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/image-optimization">Image Optimisation</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last week I built <a href="https://alculator.zachmanson.com">Alculator</a> using Next.js and hosted on Vercel. The site uses data lovingly freebooted from the Dan Murphy's public API to rank products by the ratio of price to standard drinks, and displaying this data in a card.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/alculator-cards.png" /></p>
<p>The images for these cards are hosted on a Dan Murphy's server (media.danmurphys.com.au), and I am simply using Next.js <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> tags to point to them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>...
    &lt;div className=&quot;card center&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div
        className=&quot;flex center-aligned&quot;
        onClick={() =&gt; (window.location.href = `https://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/${item.stockcode}`)}
      &gt;
        &lt;Image
          alt=&quot;Image of drink&quot;
          height=&quot;100&quot;
          width=&quot;80&quot;
          src={`https://media.danmurphys.com.au/dmo/product/${item.stockcode}-1.png`}
        /&gt;
        &lt;div className=&quot;fill-width&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div className=&quot;flex space-between align-center&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;{item.name}&lt;/h3&gt;
...
</code></pre></div>
<p>I'm using Vercel's free tier to serve the application which grants 100GB of bandwidth, which is magnitudes higher than any amount of users I expected to serve. I put the finishing touches on the site on December 30th, sent the link to a few people and went to the pub.</p>
<p>Over the next few hours I started receiving strongly worded alerts from Vercel:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/vercel-warnings.png" /></p>
<p>Either I had gone viral or my code was a lot more inefficient than I thought. At 1am I returned home, having reached the Ballmer Peak to diagnose the problem.</p>
<p>On the Vercel/Dashboard/Usage page, right at the bottom is the harmless looking graph titled "Image Optimisations" which turned out to be the culprit. By default, Vercel takes all images hosted in <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> tags and caches them all at the Edge. Vercel had optimised 1400 of these images before I discovered this and at the free tier this is capped at 1000 images. Whoops.</p>
<p>The solution is simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// next-config.js</span>

<span class="cm">/** @type {import(&#39;next&#39;).NextConfig} */</span>
<span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">nextConfig</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

            <description>Using Pandoc to well below its fullest potential!</description>
            
            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a Swiss Army knife that I exclusively use to cut cheese.</p>
<p>Every time I begin to write for this site, I open Codium and create a new file in my repo. Then I realise I meant to create a new folder, call myself an idiot and start over. This is the first step of my process, which currently concludes with running my anemic static site generator. I hope to soon replace with this a bespoke and iron proficient(?) site generator, but until then I will continue using Pandoc to fulfill my static site generator requirements.</p>
<p>My static site generator requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown input</li>
<li>Code highlighting</li>
<li>with theming?</li>
<li>Simple templating</li>
<li>Minimum (ideally 0) dependencies</li>
<li>Automated?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown-input">Markdown Input</h2>
<p>It can convert documents between myriad formats, most relevantly Markdown to HTML.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pandoc<span class="w"> </span>inputfile.md<span class="w"> </span>-o<span class="w"> </span>output.html<span class="w"> </span>--to<span class="o">=</span>html5
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="code-highlighting">Code Highlighting</h2>
<p>There are plenty of tools that can do this, but Pandoc was the first I found that had code highlighting without having any depedencies like <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>, just saving the colour information in inline CSS</p>
<p>Any fenced Markdown code blocks with a language specified (like the following) will have the syntax automatically highlighted by Pandoc.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gh"># Title</span>

<span class="gu">## Subtitle</span>

Lorem ipsum amirite.  Hey look a fenced code block:

<span class="sb">```Python</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;x is equal to 5&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="sb">```</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pandoc will turn this Markdown into the following HTML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;title&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Title<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>The various HTML tag class spaghetti are used to highlight the code, though the CSS required to actually make this work is not included in the standard Pandoc command invocation. To actually generate the CSS that makes these classes work you need to use the <code>--standalone</code> flag, à la:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pandoc<span class="w"> </span>inputfile.md<span class="w"> </span>-o<span class="w"> </span>output.html<span class="w"> </span>--to<span class="o">=</span>html5<span class="w"> </span>--standalone
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will include some inline CSS, along the lines of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">span</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">al</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">color</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">#ff0000</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">bold</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c">/* Alert */</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This CSS is great, but only actually needs to be generated once. I copied this CSS in a single <a href="https://github.com/pavo-etc/pavo-etc.github.io/blob/94d59de43188660d625d12b5df33894841f99922/styles/code.css">file</a>. After copying this text, the <code>--standalone</code> flag can be omitted.</p>
<h3 id="with-theming">with theming?</h3>
<p>The colours used in the highlighting can be customised! As with everything else in my life at the moment, I use <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which thankfully <a href="https://draculatheme.com/pandoc">already has a theme for Pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>Once the theme is installed, Pandoc can highlight using the theme with the <code>--defaults</code> flag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pandoc<span class="w"> </span>inputfile.md<span class="w"> </span>-o<span class="w"> </span>output.html<span class="w"> </span>--to<span class="o">=</span>html5<span class="w"> </span>--standalone<span class="w"> </span>--defaults<span class="w"> </span>path/to/theme/dracula.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>The HTML classes will be the same names regardless of the theme, but the inline CSS will be dependent on the theme. Again, this only needs to be run once, and the inline CSS can be copied and saved to be used later.</p>
<h2 id="simple-templating">Simple Templating</h2>
<p>Pandoc makes it simple, as long as you only need simple template insertions! HTML templates can be created easily. A basic template could look like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="na">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;/styles/code.css&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>$title$<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">header</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>$title$<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>$subtitle$<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>$date$<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">header</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">article</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        $body$
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">article</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note the inclusion of the stylesheet. <code>code.css</code> includes the CSS for code highlighting.</p>
<p>The <code>body</code> variable is automatically assigned to the content of the Markdown file, and the rest of the variables can be assigned manually using a YAML header in the Markdown file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>---

<p>To use the template, you use the <code>--template</code> flag in the Pandoc invocation:</p>

<p>It opens every directory (except those in <code>nonposts</code>), runs pandoc on a Markdown file with the same name as the directory, and outputs <code>index.html</code> based on <code>templates/template.html</code>.</p>
<p>The top level <code>index.html</code> is not modified by the script at all. This page presumably would link to the subdirectories and must be manually modified. Ugh.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>As of Minecraft version 1.18.1, there are 739 crafting recipes in the game...depending on how you count. This little rabbithole is something I fell into during a meeting for a group project this week. The project tasks us with building a "daily puzzle game" in vein of Wordle, as my web development unit likes the idea of looking anachronistic in a few years.</p>
<p>The meeting was very preliminary, essentially just getting to know one another and bounce some ideas off each other. One idea I had been mulling over was "Wordle but with for Minecraft crafting recipes", which requires no explanation for players of these two games (which among my peers includes everyone). My group immediately latched onto the idea, but acknowledged the scope of including all Minecraft recipes would be challenge, both in terms of game design and actually acquiring them.</p>
<p>Transcribing by hand was possible but likely impractical, as was automatically scraping the <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki">wiki</a>. Luckily, the thousands of modders before us had poured through Minecraft's source file and through <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/382431/list-of-all-minecraft-crafting-recipes-for-crafting-web">cursory googling</a> we were able to get to <code>.minecraft/versions/1.18.1.jar/data/minecraft/recipes/</code>, where all crafting recipes in the game are stored as lovely little JSON files. Perfect!</p>
<p>Upon further inspection there are some mildly interesting quirks within these JSON files. The majority of recipes vaguely follow this format:</p>

<p>Seems like a straightforward and logical way of laying it all out. Presumably the "type" being "crafting_shaped" is to denote recipes with particular shapes (like a dispenser) as different from recipes where block arrangement doesn't matter (like mushroom stew).</p>

<p>The count value determine how many items are output by the recipe, and appears in over 579 total recipes. For the standard crafting recipes this value only appears for recipes that output more than 1 item, but curiously stonecutter recipes always include this value.</p>
<p>All this elicited a nose exhale and an "oh neat" from me as I poked around the files. Most of these details aren't important to the project, but the parts that are important will be a huge time save. Web scraping in my experience is a pain (though somehow I think the maintainers of the Minecraft wiki would be more consistent than the <a href="https://github.com/pavo-etc/wa-covid-tracker/blob/1e1e8e317084e22aba6c143afbe9a8249e6231dc/scraper.py#L29">WA Government</a>).</p>
<p>Now we can focus on the real trouble - every other aspect of puzzle game design and web development. I am particularly not looking forward to dealing with the interaction between Wordle-style position hints and different crafting orientation/positions.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2022-06-05:</strong></p>
<p><a href="/minecraftle">Minecraftle</a> is <a href="https://minecraftle.zachmanson.com">playable</a> and nearly fully finished. We submitted two weeks ago but there are a few things I want to implement for my own interest. The JSON files discussed in this post were used, but their format was inconvenient for querying so needed to be restructured. Yesterday I rewrote the script to restructure the recipe JSON files since the initial version was a mess, and finally implemented the functions to validate recipes on object placement. These changes revealed a few more quirks in the recipe JSON files.</p>
<p>Some recipes have multiple forms, such as torches which use coal or charcoal. I had assumed this would just result in two seperate recipe files, but:</p>

<p>This actually caused a mild issue in Minecraftle that I currently have a hacky solution for. As far as I can tell this doesn't appear in many recipes (though I'm too lazy to write the regex to check). When we restructure the JSON files, we simplify the format so the <code>pattern</code> field contains the actual item names rather than character representations. This doesn't leave much room alternate forms, short of just repeating the whole recipe with the differing items. While totally possible, I just forced it to select the first item whenever there are multiple options. This means that you would be unable to craft a torch with charcoal.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell this poses no issues since in Minecraftle's current form you don't receive charcoal as a crafting ingredient, and I am yet to find another appearance of this format that uses the items in <code>given_ingredients.json</code>. I'm still uncomfortable with this though, and I hope to come back and fix it after exams.</p>
<p>Another oddity reared its head with stone tools:</p>

<p>See it? <code>tag</code> replaces <code>item</code> in a number of cases, such as stone tools. Blackstone and cobbled deepslate have been added fairly recently to the game, and can be used for interchangably for cobblestone in a number of recipes. This kind of notation appears in a number of recipes:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>These tags are referring to <code>.minecraft/versions/1.18.1.jar/data/minecraft/tags/items/</code>, which holds yet more JSON files with lists of all items that belong to each tag. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>cat<span class="w"> </span>stone_crafting_materials.json
<span class="o">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s2">&quot;replace&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span>false,
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s2">&quot;values&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;minecraft:cobblestone&quot;</span>,
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;minecraft:blackstone&quot;</span>,
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;minecraft:cobbled_deepslate&quot;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To deal with these I've currently just put edge cases in to handle these tags manually, though I would like to have a more robust solution in the future that can be determined by <code>given_ingredients.json</code>.</p>
<p>Both of these appear to be solving the same problem, and it's strange that coal doesn't use the <code>tag</code> field, especially since there is <code>tag</code> JSON file that seems made for this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>cat<span class="w"> </span>coals.json
<span class="o">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s2">&quot;replace&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span>false,
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s2">&quot;values&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;minecraft:coal&quot;</span>,
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;minecraft:charcoal&quot;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I theorize that the torch was older method of achieving this goal and just hasn't been updated to use the new system (though I am again too lazy and won't check old versions), unless there is some other difference I am not aware of between the two methods. Maybe I should send Mojang a pull request.</p>
<p>Recipe validation was the final feature I really felt was necessary for my own sense of completion. That said, we never added shapeless recipe support... or varying difficulties... or hardcore mode. Oh well.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>I spend an inordinate amount of time reading arguments on the internet. Every now and then I'll find one that is actually thoughtful and in-depth. One with more kindness than usual, with genuine attempts to understand the perspectives of each other.</p>

<p>These are rare. But it isn't rare that upon finding one of these I will glance at the usernames.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>I recently received access to DALL-E and played around with it for a while. The interface is simple, just a textbox and a few curated images to give you some inspiration.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/dall-e.jpg" /></p>
<p>Once you submit a prompt to DALL-E, you are shown more curated images and their corresponding prompts while your request is processed.</p>
<p>DALL-E is capable of producing some amazing images. It takes a bit of warming up, but after little practice I was able to create wonderful and bizarre generative art. Despite this, I felt I didn't know how to produce something as interesting or engaging as their curated images the presented to me when using DALL-E. I could logically understand that the tool had potential, but I felt separated from it.</p>
<p>Using Midjourney is completely a different experience. Midjourney currently runs its generative art AI through a bot on their company Discord server. You generate images by typing in a command in certain channels, and all the images produced are visible to everyone on the server simultaneously. Before you can even type something you are assaulted by an unfiltered, non-curated array of incredible images, all diffusing right before your eyes.</p>
<video autoplay loop muted>
   <source src="/media/firehose.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

<p>While both generators are impressive, using Midjourney was a visceral experience for me in a way that DALL-E was not. DALL-E is sipping a glass of water, Midjourney is a firehose blasting your face. I was immediately in awe.</p>
<p>The design of Midjourney makes it abundantly clear how big an impact this technology will have on the world. Watching hundreds of strangers generate images in real-time is jaw dropping. I was mesmerised, and within minutes saw images that moved me, despite being created by an AI without any intention behind them.</p>
<p>While I am sure both of these are the future, only one made me feel it.</p>

            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://minecraftle.zachmanson.com">Minecraftle</a> is a simple game written for my introductory web development unit (CITS3403 with Tim French, would recommend) in 2022 Semester 1. The project was submitted (and completed) on May 23, but since then I have been periodically updating it with "nice to have" features that we didn't manage to get in before the deadline. After 8 months I am happy to label this <a href="/minecraftle">Minecraftle</a> version 1.1, with changes stemming from three main motivations: usability, optimisation, and revenge.</p>

<p><code>c502eb2</code>: Rewrote the entire script that turned the 600+ Minecraft crafting recipe JSON files into single file with a usable schema. Previous implementation was very messy, future modifications will be much easier.</p>
<p><code>172b3f2</code>: Optimised recipes validation, still relatively inefficient though.</p>
<p><code>cd0c61e</code>: Made game submission API a seperate endpoint to user stats endpoint, rather than being a hacky overload of the stats endpoint.</p>
<p><code>007865b</code>: Significantly reduced size of <code>recipes.json</code> to only include recipes that are actually possible to create with the given ingredients. This reduces initial pageload time and reduces load on my server.</p>
<p><code>007865b</code>: Set <code>init.js</code> to store <code>recipes.json</code> and <code>items.json</code> in local storage, and only request them if they don't exist there. This makes pageloading much faster, and reduces load on my server.</p>
<h2 id="revenge">Revenge</h2>
<p>Since initial release 2500+ people have played the game. From what I can tell this primary originated from popularity at a local primary school and the now-defunct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220927035303/https://likewordle.com/">LikeWordle.com</a>. Most of these players haven't become regular users though, only playing one or two games. Really its just me and my ex competing for the number one spot on the leaderboard. After months of hard work she overtook me as number 1 and I have been clawing my way back ever since. Obviously I could cheat since I'm the admin but where's the fun in that? Despite that, I'm not opposed to adding features to help me take back the crown.</p>
<p><code>309a557</code>: Added indicators to the stats page to show users how far behind and ahead they are of their neighbours on the leaderboard.</p>
<p><code>5dca9d2</code>: Added an account recovery button since I accidentally deleted my account the day after taking back the crown (I swear). This does expose a prexisting security flaw, but does enable it to be used in a positive way. For reference, clearing your browser data will make your device forget which account is it associated with.</p>
<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<p><code>23dc225</code>: Fixed bug caused by the use of item tags in Minecraft source files. Item tags represent groups of items that are effectively interchangable in crafting recipes, such as coal and charcoal. Minecraftle conversion scripts have been updated to expect this, and will replace these with the preferred variant e.g. coal/charcoal group will be replaced with coal.</p>
<p><code>d98e83a</code>: Forced game to be set to Perth timezone. Deployment VPS is in North America, so the server-side calculation of the current recipes wasn't changing at midnight in Perth, where most of the player base is.</p>
<p><code>c0ce8c2</code>: Fixed stick recipe being overwritten by second stick recipes that uses bamboo.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was some of the first <a href="/javascript">JavaScript</a> I ever wrote and it reflects that, much of the old code makes me want to cringe. With the benefit of 6 months professionally working on large <a href="/typescript">TypeScript</a> projects, Minecraftle seems quaint (and somewhat shocking that it even works).</p>
<p>Regardless, it holds a place in my heart as my first <a href="/web-development">web development</a> project with any complexity and is likely responsible for getting my foot in the door at my current job. For this reason I am willing to continue tending the garden it occupies.</p>]]>
