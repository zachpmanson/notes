        <h1>The Unknown Citizen</h1>
      </header>
      <article><p>A poem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden">W. H. Auden</a> in 1939 about life.</p>
<hr />
<p>He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be<br />
One against whom there was no official complaint,<br />
And all the reports on his conduct agree<br />
That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,<br />
For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.<br />
Except for the War till the day he retired<br />
He worked in a factory and never got fired,<br />
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.<br />
Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,<br />
For his Union reports that he paid his dues,<br />
(Our report on his Union shows it was sound)<br />
And our Social Psychology workers found<br />
That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.<br />
The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day<br />
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.<br />
Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,<br />
And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.<br />
Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare<br />
He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan<br />
And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,<br />
A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.<br />
Our researchers into Public Opinion are content<br />
That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;<br />
When there was peace, he was for peace: when there was war, he went.<br />
He was married and added five children to the population,<br />
Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.<br />
And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.<br />
Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:<br />
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.</p></article>
