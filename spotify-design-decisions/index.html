      <h1>Spotify Design Decisions</h1>
    </header>
    <article><p>This page is a list of design decisions made by Spotify that I consider shitty.  I'm sure some of there were A/B tested, coming and going silently, but some have lingered for years. In any case I have experienced (have been subjected to) all of these personally and they piss me off greatly.</p>
<h2 id="smart-shuffle-button-cycle-lock">Smart Shuffle Button Cycle Lock</h2>
<p>Spotify has added a feature called Smart Shuffle that works like normal shuffling, but also added recommended songs in-between ever few tracks in the queue.  On paper I like this feature, though I have never found myself actually using it. I was introduced to it through the following infuriating UX.</p>
<p>I go the the Now Playing screen on the Android Spotify client. The playlist I am listening to is currently set to shuffle (regular shuffle), but I would like to turn off regular shuffle.  I press the button with a shuffle icon, which has for 10+ years been a single toggle that would instantly take effect.  Instead of a simple 2 option toggle, I find that it has been converted in to a 3 option cycle button, where pressing it cycles through the options of <code>Linear -&gt; Shuffle -&gt; Smart Shuffle -&gt; Linear</code>.  I can see the thinking behind this decision though I don't like it since it breaks muscle memory established by this app for a decade and all other music playing applications.  That is not my issue though.</p>
<p>When you click the button and move the state from <code>Shuffle</code> to <code>Smart Shuffle</code>, the application begins loading the Smart Shuffle recommendations which means it must query Spotify servers, which is an operation that takes multiple seconds.  While this occurs, the button with a Shuffle icon becomes a button with a loading spinner, and becomes unclickable. I must wait multiple seconds before I can turn off Smart Shuffle.</p>
<p><code>Linear -&gt; Shuffle -&gt; Loading (multiple seconds) -&gt; Smart Shuffle -&gt; Linear</code></p>
<p>This is deeply infuriating.  I never even wanted to use Smart Shuffle in the first place and now I must wait for it.</p>
<p>This occurred every time I wanted to turn off  <code>Shuffle</code>.  Which is a lot.</p>
<p>As of 2024-01-21, this loading state of the button appears to have been removed, but the button still is a 3 option cycle which I dislike.</p>
<h2 id="upcoming-complains">Upcoming Complains</h2>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart Shuffle popup</li>
<li>Rapidly toggling through Shuffle button states can cause the cycle to desync in strange ways</li>
<li>Can't swipe right to add track to queue in a Blend playlist (Android)</li>
<li>Can swipe down to dismiss Now Playing screen but cannot swipe up to make it appear again (just skips to next track) (Android)</li>
<li>Spotify (regular) Shuffle algorithm has some problems</li>
