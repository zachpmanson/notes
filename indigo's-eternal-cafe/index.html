It, understandably, changed management several times and experienced the ups and downs you'd expect of a long running establishment, but it always maintained a furiously loyal customer base. Though each patron appreciated it for their own reasons, it was generally agreed upon amongst patrons that Indigo's Corner Cafe guranteed three things. Mildly above average coffee, subdued music that was only consciously noticeable when conversation lulled, and that you could say with extreme certainty it would be open with a table available on any given day (barring Mondays, obviously). </p>

Three presidents, nineteen conquerors, forty-one explorers, fifty-four famous artists, seven million successful artists, and two-hundred and thirty-seven million lovers, if you round down. All customers were provided with warm service that waned as waiters' shifts grew long, and were greeted and gently accused by a carved wooden sign by the door:  </p>
