# Ochrs

This is the repo for the Ochrs 2.0 static wiki generator and my personal Obsidian vault used to populate it.

It is built using the `generator.py` script, which traverses the `/notes` directory and writes it to a flat file structure in `/site`, which is a static site that can be served.  I'm currently putting the `/site` directory into the `gh-pages` branch of this repo.  The deployed version is accessible at [notes.zachmanson.com](https://notes.zachmanson.com).

More details on Ochrs can be found on the [deployed wiki page](https://notes.zachmanson.com/ochrs/) for it, or wherever the Ochrs.md file is in this repo.
