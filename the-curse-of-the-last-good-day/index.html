      <h1>Spoilers for The Fault in Our Stars, I guess</h1>
    </header>
    <article><p><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> describes the phenomenon of the Last Good Day, a concept that has been echoing in my head ever since I read the book in high school. In the novel, the Last Good Day is the final time a person who is slowly deteriorating has a peaceful and pleasant moment with those around them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no way of knowing that your last good day is Your Last Good Day. At the time, it is just another good day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story presents this in the context of Augustus' worsening condition and eventual death.</p>
<p>So far, I've been lucky enough to be free of facing slow health declines in myself and those close to me, but the concept of the Last Good Day has sat quietly in the back of my mind since first encountering it. Whenever I have some kind of impending loss, no matter how small, my thoughts tend to orbit around it.</p>
<p>With my bachelor's degree coming to a close soon, lots of my friends are moving away for careers or further study in other countries. The groups that have formed won't continue to exist in the way the have for the last 3 years. Not everyone is leaving of course and no one person is single load-bearing pillar of the group, but buildings tend not to handle losing half their supports.</p>
<p>I've been aware that this will happen for months, and at every group event in my head I'm constantly thinking <em>Is this going to be the Last Good Day? Is this Good enough? Can I make this better?</em> This is definitely not healthy and definitely doesn't help me enjoy the limited time left with my friends. This line of thinking is something I hesitate to even talk about with my friends in fear of inspiring the same kind of thought spirals in their minds.</p>
<p>Time has gone on and the erosion has begun. As I write this, another will be flying to Sydney tomorrow morning. Enough friends have left now that the Last Good Day has certainly passed, and yet I'm still not 100% sure which day it was. There's some strong contenders though.</p>
<p>That's life, I know I'll make more friends and there's no need to be melodramatic. Regardless, I'm going to miss this period and the people I've spent it with.</p>
<p>Cheers and auld lang syne and so on.</p></article>
